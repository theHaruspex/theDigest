 magine you have a brother and he’s an alcoholic. He has his moments, but you keep your distance from him. You don’t mind him for the occasional family gathering or holiday. You still love him. But you don’t want to be around him. This is how I lovingly describe my current relationship with the United States. The United States is my alcoholic brother. And although I will always love him, I don’t want to be near him at the moment.
</p>
<p>
 I know that’s harsh, but I really feel my home country is not in a good place these days. That’s not a socioeconomic statement (although that’s
 <a href="/american-dream" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  on the decline as well
 </a>
 ), but rather a cultural one.
</p>
<p>
 I realize it’s going to be impossible to write sentences like the ones above without coming across as a raging prick, so let me try to soften the blow to my American readers with an analogy:
</p>
<p>
 You know when you move out of your parents’ house and live on your own, how you start hanging out with your friends’ families and you realize that actually, your family was a little screwed up? As it turns out, stuff you always assumed was normal your
 <a href="/parents" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  entire childhood was pretty weird
 </a>
 and may have actually fucked you up a little bit. You know, dad thinking it was funny to wear a Santa Claus hat in his underwear every Christmas or the fact that you and your sister slept in the same bed until you were 22, or that your mother routinely cried over a bottle of wine while listening to Elton John.
</p>
<p>
 The point is we don’t really get perspective on what’s close to us until we spend time away from it. Just like you didn’t realize the weird quirks and nuances of your family until you left and spent time with others, the same is true for country and culture. You often don’t see what’s messed up about your country and culture
 <a href="/courses/escape-plan/introduction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  until you step outside of it
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 And so even though this article is going to come across as fairly scathing, I want my American readers to know this: some of the stuff we do, some of the stuff that we always assumed was normal, it’s kind of screwed up. And that’s OK. Because that’s true with
 <a href="/5-life-lessons-5-years-traveling-world" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  every culture
 </a>
 . It’s just easier to spot it in others (e.g., the French) so we don’t always notice it in ourselves.
</p>
<p>
 So as you read this article, know that I’m saying everything with tough love, the same tough love with which I’d sit down and lecture an alcoholic family member. It doesn’t mean I don’t love you. It doesn’t mean there aren’t some awesome things about you (BRO, THAT’S AWESOME!!!). And it doesn’t mean I’m some saint either because god knows I’m pretty screwed up (I’m American, after all). There are just a few things you need to hear. And as a friend, I’m going to tell them to you.
</p>
<p>
 And to my foreign readers, get your necks ready, because this is going to be a nod-a-thon.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  A Little “What The Hell Does This Guy Know?” Background:
 </strong>
 I’ve lived in half a dozen states in the US, primarily in the deep south and the northeast. I have visited 45 of the US’s 50 states. I also
 <a href="/courses/escape-plan/lesson-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  lived abroad for several years
 </a>
 , primarily in South America and Asia (with various stints in Europe). I
 <a href="/foreign-language" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  speak three languages
 </a>
 . I’m married to a foreigner. So I feel like I have a good perspective on the US from both the inside and outside.
</p>
<p>
 (Note: I realize all the things on this list are generalizations and I realize there are always exceptions. I get it. You don’t have to send 55 emails telling me that you and your best friend are exceptions. If you really get that offended from some guy’s blog post, you may want to double-check your life priorities.)
</p>
<p>
 OK, we’re ready now. 10 things Americans don’t know about America.
</p>
<p>
 Unless you’re speaking with a real estate agent or a prostitute, chances are they’re not going to be excited that you’re American. It’s not some badge of honor we get to parade around. Yes, we had Steve Jobs and Thomas Edison, but unless you actually
 <em>
  are
 </em>
 Steve Jobs or Thomas Edison (which is unlikely), then most people around the world are simply not going to care. There are exceptions of course. And those exceptions are called English and Australian people. Whoopdie-fucking-doo.
</p>
<p>
 As Americans, we’re brought up our entire lives being taught that we’re the best, we did everything first and that the rest of the world follows our lead. Not only is this
 <a href="/being-special" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  not true
 </a>
 , but people get irritated when you bring it to their country with you. So don’t.
</p>
<p>
 Despite the occasional eye-rolling, and complete inability to understand why anyone would vote for George W. Bush (twice), people from other countries don’t hate us either. In fact — and I know this is a really sobering realization for us —
 <em>
  most people in the world don’t really think about us or care about us
 </em>
 . I know, that sounds absurd, especially with CNN and Fox News showing the same 20 angry Arab men on repeat for ten years straight. But unless we’re invading someone’s country or threatening to invade someone’s country (which is likely), then there’s a 99.99% chance they don’t care about us. Just like we rarely think about the people in Bolivia or Mongolia, most people don’t think about us much. They have jobs, kids, house payments — you know, those things called lives — to worry about. Kind of like us.
</p>
<p>
 Americans tend to assume that the rest of the world either loves us or hates us (this is actually a good litmus test to tell if someone is conservative or liberal). The fact is, most people feel neither. Most people don’t think much about us.
</p>
<p>
 Remember that immature girl in high school, how every little thing that happened to her meant that someone either hated her or was obsessed with her; who thought every teacher who ever gave her a bad grade was being totally unfair and everything good that happened to her was because of how amazing she was? Yeah, we’re that immature high school girl.
</p>
<p>
 For all of our talk about being global leaders and how everyone follows us, we don’t seem to know much about our supposed “followers.” They often have completely different takes on history than we do. Here were some brain-stumpers for me: the Vietnamese were more
 <a href="http://links.org.au/node/15" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  concerned with independence
 </a>
 (not us), Hitler was primarily
 <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/rbth/opinion/7737591/Remember-the-Russian-peoples-role-in-World-War-Two-defeating-Nazi-Germany.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  defeated by the Soviet Union
 </a>
 (not us), there is evidence that Native Americans were wiped out largely by disease and plague
 <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/apocalypic-mysterious-plague-killed-millions-of-native-americans-the-1500s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  BEFORE
 </a>
 Europeans arrived and not just after, and the American Revolution was partly “won” because the British invested more of their resources in
 <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/american-revolution-was-just-one-battlefront-huge-world-war-180969444/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  fighting France
 </a>
 (not us). Notice a running theme here?
</p>
<p>
 (Hint: It’s not all about us. The world is more complicated.)
</p>
<p>
 We did not invent democracy. We didn’t even invent modern democracy. There were parliamentary systems in England and other parts of Europe over a hundred years before we created a government. In a recent
 <a href="https://blogs.harvard.edu/mesh/2008/01/graph_americans_lost_on_map/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  survey of young Americans
 </a>
 , 63% could not find Iraq on a map (despite being at war with them), and 54% did not know Sudan was a country in Africa. Yet, somehow we’re positive that everyone else looks up to us.
</p>

</p>
<p>
 There’s a saying about English-speakers. We say “Go fuck yourself,” when we really mean “I like you,” and we say “I like you,” when we really mean “Go fuck yourself.”
</p>
<p>
 Outside of getting shit-housed drunk and screaming “I LOVE YOU, MAN!”, open displays of affection in American culture are tepid and rare. Latin and some European cultures describe us as “cold” and “passionless” and for good reason. In our social lives, we don’t say what we mean and we don’t mean what we say.
</p>
<p>
 In our culture, appreciation and affection are implied rather than spoken outright. Two guy friends call each other names to reinforce their friendship; men and women tease and
 <a href="/the-dismal-state-of-flirting-in-english-speaking-cultures" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  make fun of each other to imply interest
 </a>
 . Feelings are almost never shared openly and freely.
 <a href="/insecurity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  Consumer culture
 </a>
 has cheapened our language of gratitude. Something like, “It’s so good to see you” is empty now because it’s expected and heard from everybody.
</p>
<p>
 In dating, when I find a woman attractive, I almost always walk right up to her and tell her that a) I wanted to meet her, and b) she’s beautiful. In America, women usually get incredibly nervous and confused when I do this. They’ll make jokes to defuse the situation or sometimes ask me if I’m part of a TV show or something playing a prank. Even when they’re interested and go on dates with me, they get a bit disoriented when I’m so blunt with my interest. Whereas, in almost every other culture approaching women this way is met with a confident smile and a “Thank you.”
</p>
<p>
 Supposedly, Pablo Escobar once said, “I’m not a rich man; I’m a poor man with a lot of money.”
</p>
<p>
 The United States is not a rich country, it’s a poor country with a lot of money. If you’re extremely talented or intelligent, the US is probably the best place in the world to live. The system is stacked heavily to allow people of talent and advantage to rise to the top quickly.
</p>
<p>
 The problem with the US is that
 <a href="/american-dream" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  <em>
   everyone
  </em>
  thinks they are of talent and advantage
 </a>
 . As John Steinbeck famously said, the problem with poor Americans is that “they don’t believe they’re poor, but rather temporarily embarrassed millionaires.” It’s this culture of self-delusion that allows America to continue to innovate and churn out new industry more than anyone else in the world. But this shared delusion also unfortunately keeps perpetuating large social inequalities and the quality of life for the average citizen lower than most other developed countries. It’s the price we pay to maintain our growth and economic dominance.
</p>
<p>
 To me, being wealthy is having the freedom to maximize one’s life experiences. In those terms, despite the average American having more material wealth than citizens of most other countries (more cars, bigger houses, nicer televisions), their overall quality of life suffers in my opinion. American people on average
 <a href="http://20somethingfinance.com/american-hours-worked-productivity-vacation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  work more hours
 </a>
 with less vacation, spend
 <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Traffic/story?id=485098&amp;page=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  more time commuting
 </a>
 every day, and are saddled with
 <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/11/news/economy/fed-family-net-worth/index.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  over $10,000
 </a>
 of debt. That’s a lot of time spent working and buying crap and little time or disposable income for relationships, activities, or new experiences.
</p>
<p>
 In 2010, I got into a taxi in Bangkok to take me to a new six-story cineplex. It was accessible by metro, but I chose a taxi instead. On the seat in front of me was a sign with a wifi password. Wait, what? I asked the driver if he had wifi in his taxi. He flashed a huge smile. The squat Thai man, with his pidgin English, explained that he had installed it himself. He then turned on his new sound system and disco lights. His taxi instantly became a cheesy nightclub on wheels… with free wifi.
</p>
<p>
 If there’s one constant in my travels over the past few years, it has been that almost every place I’ve visited (especially in Asia and South America) is much nicer and safer than I expected it to be. Singapore is pristine. Hong Kong makes Manhattan look like a suburb. My neighborhood in Colombia is nicer than the one I lived in Boston (and cheaper).
</p>
<p>

 As Americans, we have this naïve assumption that people all over the world are struggling and way behind us. They’re not. Sweden and South Korea have more advanced high-speed internet networks. Japan has the most advanced trains and transportation systems. Norwegians — along with Swedes, Luxembourgers, the Dutch and Finns —
 <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/166211/worldwide-median-household-income-000.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_target">

 </a>
 . The biggest and most
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380#Entry_into_service" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  advanced plane
 </a>
 in the world is flown out of Singapore. The tallest buildings in the world are now in Dubai and Shanghai (and soon to be
 <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/17/world/meast/saudi-arabia-to-build-tallest-building-ever/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  Saudi Arabia
 </a>
 ). Meanwhile, the US has the
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  highest incarceration rate
 </a>
 in the world.
</p>
<p>
 What’s so surprising about the world is how unsurprising most of it is. I spent a week with some local guys in Cambodia. You know what their biggest concerns were? Paying for school, getting to work on time, and what their friends were saying about them. In
 <a href="/brazil" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  Brazil
 </a>
 , people have debt problems, hate getting stuck in traffic, and complain about their overbearing mothers. Every country thinks they have the worst drivers. Every country thinks their weather is unpredictable. The world becomes, err… predictable.
</p>
<p>
 Not only are we
 <a href="/insecurity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  emotionally insecure as a culture
 </a>
 , but I’ve come to realize how paranoid we are about our physical security. You don’t have to watch Fox News or CNN for more than 10 minutes to hear about how our drinking water is going to kill us, our neighbor is going to rape our children, some terrorist in Yemen is going to kill us because we didn’t torture him, Mexicans are going to kill us, or some virus from a bird is going to kill us. There’s a reason we have
 <a href="http://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2013/mar/07/james-florio/jim-florio-claims-number-guns-us-almost-big-popula/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  nearly as many guns
 </a>
 as people.
</p>
<p>
 In the US, security trumps everything, even liberty. We’re paranoid.
</p>
<p>
 I’ve probably been to 10 countries now that friends and family back home told me explicitly not to go because someone was going to kill me, kidnap me, stab me, rob me, rape me, sell me into the sex trade, give me HIV, or whatever else. None of that has happened. I’ve never been robbed and I’ve walked through some of the shittiest parts of Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.
</p>
<p>
 In fact, the experience has been the opposite. In countries like Russia, Colombia, or Guatemala, people were so honest and open with me, it actually scared me. Some stranger in a bar would invite me to his house for a barbeque with his family, a random person on the street would offer to show me around and give me directions to a store I was trying to find. My American instincts were always that, “Wait, this guy is going to try to rob me or kill me,” but they never did. They were just insanely friendly.
</p>
<p>
 I’ve noticed that the way we Americans communicate is usually designed to
 <a href="/attention" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  create a lot of attention and hype
 </a>
 . Again, I think this is a product of our consumer culture: the belief that something isn’t worthwhile or important unless it’s perceived to be the best (BEST EVER!!!) or unless it gets a lot of attention (see: every reality-television show ever made).
</p>
<p>
 This is why Americans have a peculiar habit of thinking everything is “totally awesome,” and even the most mundane activities were “
 <a href="/fear-of-missing-out" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  the best thing ever!
 </a>
 ” It’s the unconscious drive we share for importance and significance, this unmentioned belief, socially beaten into us since birth that if we’re not the best at something, then we don’t matter.
</p>
<p>
 We’re status-obsessed. Our culture is built around achievement, production, and
 <a href="/being-special" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  being exceptional
 </a>
 . Therefore,
 <a href="/measure-your-life" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  comparing ourselves
 </a>
 and attempting to out-do one another has infiltrated our social relationships as well. Who can slam the most beers first? Who can get reservations at the best restaurant? Who knows the promoter to the club? Who dated a girl on the cheerleading squad? Socializing becomes objectified and turned into a competition. And if you’re not winning, the implication is that you are not important and no one will like you.
</p>
<p>
 Unless you have cancer or something as equally dire, the health care system in the US sucks. The World Health Organization
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  ranked the US 37th
 </a>
 in the world for health care, despite the fact that we spend the most per capita by a large margin.
</p>
<p>
 The hospitals are nicer in Asia (with European-educated doctors and nurses) and cost a tenth as much. Something as routine as a vaccination costs multiple hundreds of dollars in the US and less than $10 in Colombia. And before you make fun of Colombian hospitals, Colombia is 28th in the world on that WHO list, nine spots higher than us.
</p>
<p>
 A routine
 <a href="/std-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  STD test
 </a>
 that can run you over $200 in the US is free in many countries to anyone, citizen or not. My health insurance the past year? $65 a month. Why? Because I live outside of the US. An American guy I met living in Buenos Aires got knee surgery on his ACL that would have cost $10,000 in the US… for free.
</p>
<p>
 But this isn’t really getting into the real problems of our health. Our food is killing us. I’m not going to go crazy with the details, but we eat chemically-laced crap because it’s cheaper and tastes better (profit, profit). Our portion sizes are absurd (more profit). And we’re by far the most prescribed nation in the world AND our drugs cost five to ten times more than they do even in Canada (ohhhhhhh, profit, you sexy bitch).
</p>
<p>
 <img alt="Fast food: the American cuisine" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18988" data-src="https://markmanson.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/junk-food.jpg" height="691" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" srcset="https://markmanson.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/junk-food.jpg 1000w, https://markmanson.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/junk-food-768x531.jpg 768w" width="1000"/>
</p>
<p>
 In terms of
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  life expectancy
 </a>
 , despite being the richest country in the world, we come in a paltry 35th — tied with Costa Rica and right behind Slovenia, and slightly ahead of Chile, Denmark, and Cuba. Enjoy your Big Mac.
</p>
<p>
 The United States is a country built on the exaltation of economic growth and personal ingenuity. Small businesses and constant growth are
 <a href="/american-dream" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  celebrated and supported above all else
 </a>
 — above affordable health care, above
 <a href="/taught-in-school" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  respectable education
 </a>
 , above everything. Americans believe it’s your responsibility to take care of yourself and make something of yourself, not the state’s, not your community’s, not even your friend’s or family’s in some instances.
</p>
<p>
 Comfort sells easier than
 <a href="/how-to-be-happy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  happiness
 </a>
 . Comfort is easy. It requires no effort and no work.
 <a href="/hidden-costs-of-happiness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  Happiness takes effort
 </a>
 . It requires
 <a href="/happiness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  being proactive
 </a>
 , confronting fears, facing difficult situations, and having unpleasant conversations.
</p>
<p>
 Comfort equals sales. We’ve been sold comfort for generations, and for generations we bought bigger houses, separated further and further out into the suburbs, along with bigger TV’s, more movies, and take-out. The American public is becoming docile and complacent. We’re obese and entitled. When we travel, we look for giant hotels that will insulate us and pamper us rather than for legitimate cultural experiences that may
 <a href="/5-life-lessons-5-years-traveling-world" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  challenge our perspectives
 </a>
 or help us grow as individuals.
</p>
<p>
 Depression and anxiety disorders are soaring within the US. Our inability to confront anything unpleasant around us has not only created a national sense of entitlement, but it’s disconnected us from what actually drives
 <a href="/stop-trying-to-be-happy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  happiness
 </a>
 :
 <a href="/healthy-relationship-habits" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  relationships
 </a>
 , unique experiences, feeling self-validated, achieving personal goals. It’s easier to watch a NASCAR race on television and tweet about it than to actually get out and try something new with a friend.
</p>
<p>
 Unfortunately, a by-product of our massive commercial success is that we’re able to avoid the necessary
 <a href="/happiness-not-enough" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  emotional struggles of life
 </a>
 and instead indulge in easy, superficial pleasures.
</p>
<p>
 <span class="2tzeuSaXJj95ikZlqw38soTG1rmgFpM">

 Throughout history, every dominant civilization eventually collapsed because it became TOO successful. What made it powerful and unique
 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Breakdown-Nations-Leopold-Kohr/dp/0710208898" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  grows out of proportion and consumes its society
 </a>
 . I think this is true for American society. We’re complacent, entitled and unhealthy. My generation is the first generation of Americans who will be worse off than their parents, economically, physically, and
 <a href="/fuck-your-feelings" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  emotionally
 </a>
 . And this is not due to a lack of resources, to a lack of education or to a lack of ingenuity. It’s corruption and complacency. The corruption from the massive industries that control our government’s policies, and the fat complacency of the people to sit around and let it happen.
</p>
<p>
 There are things I love about my country. I don’t hate the US and I still return to it a few times a year. But I think the greatest flaw of American culture is our blind self-absorption. In the past, it only hurt other countries. But now it’s
 <a href="/american-dream" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  starting to hurt ourselves
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 So this is my unsolicited lecture to my alcoholic brother — my own flavor of arrogance and self-absorption, even if slightly more informed — in hopes he’ll give up his wayward ways. I imagine it’ll fall on deaf ears, but it’s the most I can do for now. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some funny cat pictures to look at.
</p>
