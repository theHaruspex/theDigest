 f you’re a human and you have a brain, then you probably like using your brain. And if you
 <a href="/10-cool-things-about-the-brain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  like using your brain
 </a>
 , then you love having those epiphany moments where your hair blows back and you go “Whoa” like Keanu Reeves in
 <i>
  The Matrix
 </i>
 when he learns Kung Fu from a USB drive in his neck.
</p>
<p>
 I know it’s not what the cool kids like to do, but I like to read non-fiction. Lots of non-fiction. And my favorite moments reading non-fiction are when a book bitchslaps my brain and reconfigures my entire understanding of reality and my place within it.
</p>
<p>
 I love that. It’s like a mind orgasm.
</p>
<p>
 I get a lot of emails asking me for book recommendations. I never know what the hell to say because so many of the
 <a href="/6-books">
  books that have influenced me
 </a>
 have done so not because they’re so good or brilliant, but mostly because they addressed the issues I was going through at the time I was reading them.
</p>
<p>
 So instead of divulging what
 <em>
  my
 </em>
 favorite books are, I’ll leave you with something better: seven of the most mind-fucking, reality-reshaping, Keanu Reeves “Whoa” inspiring books that I’ve ever read.

   Stumbling on Happiness
  </i>
 </a>
 is like the red-headed stepchild of happiness books. It doesn’t fit in with the rest because it basically tries to convince you that you don’t even know what the hell makes you happy in the first place, so why stress out about it?
</p>
<p>
 Gilbert is a famous Harvard psychologist who has a knack for coming up with zany experiments that show just how
 <a href="/trust" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  flawed and biased the human mind is
 </a>
 . In the book, he shows you time and again that as humans, we inaccurately judge, among other things, what made us happy in the past, what will make us happy in the future, and even what is
 <a href="/stop-trying-to-be-happy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  making us happy right at this moment
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 In fact, decades of Gilbert’s research on happiness all points to the same unsettling fact: happiness has little to do with what happens to us in our lives, and more to do with
 <a href="/happiness-not-enough" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  how we end up choosing to see things
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Gilbert’s theory is that we each have a “psychological immune system,” basically a bullshit generator where our minds explain away our past experiences, our future projections and our current situations in such a way that we always maintain a baseline level of mild happiness.
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-1" id="refmark-1">

 </a>
 And it’s when this “immune system” fails that we fall into prolonged depression and/or existential crises.

  Notable Quotes:
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 “We treat our future selves as though they were our children, spending most of the hours of most of our days constructing tomorrows that we hope will make them happy… But our temporal progeny are often thankless. We toil and sweat to give them just what we think they will like, and they quit their jobs, grow their hair, move to or from San Francisco, and wonder how we could ever have been stupid enough to think they’d like that. We fail to achieve the accolades and rewards that we consider crucial to their well-being, and they end up thanking God that things didn’t work out according to our shortsighted, misguided plan.”
</p>
<p>
 “Economies thrive when individuals strive, but because individuals will only strive for their own happiness, it is essential that they mistakenly believe that producing and consuming are routes to personal well-being.”

  What It’s About:
 </strong>
 Before I explain a few of the brilliant ideas in this book, I need to get something off my chest: Taleb sounds like a pompous dick. If he’s trolling the world with his writing style, he’s doing a good job, because some passages are almost impossible to get through without either rolling your eyes at him or shoving the book through a paper shredder. If he really is this arrogant, well, then let’s just say he won’t be invited to any of my playdates anytime soon.
</p>
<p>
 Taleb has a handful of amazing ideas. I’m talking potentially life-changing, world-affecting ideas. These ideas can be explained well in about 50 pages. The other 450 pages are mostly him trying to prove how cool and cultured he is while explaining how much smarter he is than the following groups of people: academics, politicians, Nobel Prize winners, Wall Street analysts, economists, journalists, statisticians, historians, soccer moms, teachers, anybody who uses the bell curve, anybody in the social sciences, and anyone who disagrees with him.

 So what are his handful of earth-shattering ideas in

<p>
 “Antifragility is beyond

  What It’s About:
 </strong>
 Freud was an academic sensation at the beginning of the 20th century. He had invented psychoanalysis, brought the science of psychology to the mainstream, and was highly regarded in intellectual circles around Europe. Then World War I broke out, and destroyed, well, just about everything. Freud was deeply moved by the devastation and fell into a deep depression and secluded himself for much of the 1920s.
 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393304515/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0393304515&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=entsblo-20&amp;linkId=DXWHSYLZIGYNB33V" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  <i>
   Civilization and Its Discontents
  </i>
 </a>
 was the result of this depression.
</p>
<p>
 The book makes one simple argument: that humans have deep, animalistic instincts to eat, kill, or fuck everything. Freud argued that civilization could only arise when enough humans learned to repress these deeper and baser urges, to push them into the unconscious where (according to his model) they would fester and ultimately generate all sorts of neuroses.
</p>
<p>
 Freud basically came to the conclusion that as humans, we had one of two shitty options in life: 1) repress all of our basic instincts to maintain some semblance of a safe and cooperative civilization, thus making ourselves
 <a href="/the-guide-to-being-miserable" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  miserable
 </a>
 and
 <a href="/benefits-of-being-slightly-crazy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  neurotic
 </a>
 or 2) to let them all out and let shit hit the fan.
</p>
<p>
 To Freud, Hitler and World War II just proved his point a few years later. And as an Austrian Jew, he ran for the hills. The hills being London, of course. He lived out the last years of his life in a city being bombed into oblivion.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Notable Quotes:
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 “It is impossible to overlook the extent to which civilization is built up upon a renunciation of instinct.”
</p>
<p>
 “A love that does not discriminate seems to me to forfeit a part of its own value, by doing an injustice to its object.”

 <a href="/artificial-intelligence" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  likely to continue doing so
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 He then argues that because of this, in the year 2046 all of our brains are going to be digitally encrypted and uploaded to the cloud where we will all form a single, immortal consciousness that will control all computing power on the planet.
</p>
<p>
 No, seriously.
</p>
<p>
 And the fucked up part is that some of his explanation of how this is going to happen makes sense. I mean, it’s probably not going to happen. And the book reads like it was written by a middle-aged engineer who took too much acid and now desperately needs to speak with a therapist. Kurzweil claims, among other things, that baby boomers are the first generation that will conquer aging and death, and that he wants to digitally transcribe his dead father’s brain into computer software so he can like, you know, Skype chat with good ol’ dad again.

 I poke fun at Ray, but the technological possibilities presented in this book are truly mind-boggling. And we will undoubtedly see a significant percentage of them in our lifetime. Medical nanobots that live in the bloodstream that we wireless upload vaccines to. Genetic programming for newborns so parents can choose not only the physical characteristics of their children but their talents as well. Uploading and downloading

 “One cubic inch of nanotube circuitry, once fully developed, would be up to one hundred million times more powerful than the human brain.”

<p>
 “Can the pace of technological progress continue to speed up indefinitely? Isn’t there a point at which humans are unable to think fast enough to keep up? For unenhanced humans, clearly so. But what would 1,000 scientists, each 1,000 times more intelligent than human scientists today, and each operating 1,000 times faster than contemporary humans (because the information processing in their primarily non-biological brains is faster) accomplish? One chronological year would be like a millennium for them. What would they come up with?”

   The Denial of Death
  </i>
 </a>
 in a nutshell:
</p>
<p>
 Because man is the only animal capable of conceptualizing his own existence — thinking about his life,
 <a href="/the-meaning-of-life" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  questioning it
 </a>
 , imagining future possibilities — man is therefore also the only animal capable of conceptualizing his own non-existence, i.e., his own death.
</p>
<p>
 In other words, humans were given the gift of being able to imagine the future and who we want to be, but the price we pay for this gift is the realization that we will one day die. A dog doesn’t realize she’s going to die. Neither does a fish. Or a roach. But we do.
</p>
<p>
 This knowledge of our own inevitable death leads to a kind of ever-present “terror” that underlies everything we do. Becker argues that this terror inspires us all to take on what he calls a “hero project,” where we attempt to immortalize ourselves through our deeds and actions, to create something bigger than ourselves that will

  live beyond our own lives.
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 It’s when people’s hero projects contradict one another that we get conflict, violence, bigotry, and evil. It’s when hero projects fail that we fall into deep despair and depression because we’re once again confronted with the inevitability of our own death and

  Notable Quotes:
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 “Man cannot endure his own littleness unless he can translate it into meaningfulness on the largest possible level.”
</p>
<p>
 “The irony of man’s condition is that the deepest need is to be free of the anxiety of death and annihilation; but it is life itself which awakens it, and so we must shrink from being fully alive.”
</p>
<p>
 “What does it mean to be a self-conscious animal? The idea is ludicrous, if it is not monstrous. It means to know that one is food for worms. This is the terror: to have emerged from nothing, to have a name, consciousness of self, deep inner feelings, an excruciating inner yearning for life and self-expression and with all this yet to die. It seems like a hoax, which is why one type of cultural man rebels openly against the idea of God. What kind of deity would create such a complex and fancy worm food?”
