  Happy birthday to Putanumonit!
 </p>
 <p>
  Come celebrate with me next Friday (10/28) at
  <a href="http://west.bahfest.com/" target="_blank">
   Zach Weinersmith’s BAH Fest West
  </a>
  . If you move fast you can grab one of the few remaining $10 tickets. I’m giving a talk on the dumbest idea ever to solve the global food crisis. For a taste, here’s my

   performance from last year’s BAH Fest in MIT
  </a>
  where I talked about sleepwalking and
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1Wjm0o-3WY" target="_blank">
   made fun of Max Tegmark
  </a>
  . If I win, drinks on me.

  My initial plan for the blog was to quietly practice writing for a few years until I feel I can produce something that deserves to be read. Instead,
  <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/11/28/links-1115-linksgiving/" target="_blank">
   Scott Alexander linked
  </a>
  to the third post I ever wrote and brought 5,000 readers along. In late December I decided that making Scott’s blogroll would be my goal for 2016. It happened on 12/29/2015. In May, “Shopping for Happiness” was the post of the day on
  <a href="https://thebrowser.com/share-link/LGZJ" target="_blank">
   The Browser
  </a>
  , one spot ahead of Scott.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thank you Scott! And thanks to everyone who shared, reddited, tweeted, The Browsered, Metafiltered and to everyone who told their mom. Thanks to everyone who commented,

  Whenever a post of mine is shared there are discussions of it happening in 5 places at once (Reddit, LW, Facebook..) I do my best to engage with all of them, but I would love to consolidate most of the conversation here in the comments so it’s visible next to the post.
 </p>
 <p>
  Two things to encourage this: first, I would like to remind everyone of my

  One thing y’all aren’t helping me with is achieving my goal for this blog: becoming a better writer. You critique my ideas six ways to Sunday but never a grammar mistake, a poor turn of phrase, a post with a confusing structure, an incoherent explanation, or a badly constructed argument. I want my writing to be first – fun to read, second – educational, third – convincing, ultimately – inspiring. Most of the time I don’t achieve that, and I need your feedback to get better.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please share (by comment or
  <a href="mailto:putanumonit@gmail.com" target="_blank">
   email
  </a>
  ) which parts of my posts worked or didn’t for you as a written essay, arguments aside. The more specific the better: it’s easier to learn from a bad paragraph than from a bad post, even easier to improve on a single bad sentence or logical argument. Rewrite a section of the post with better language and flow to demonstrate your skills, I may even include it in the post. I’m still committed to ensuring that Putanumonit is a money-losing venture. I pay to keep this ad-free and I am willing to pay for a writing coach that impresses me enough. Or, you can make this effort as a kindness to me.
 </p>
 <p>
  My next post will the revisit the best articles I wrote this year and my follow up thoughts on them, the better to start year 2 with fresh writing and fresh ideas. My folder of draft ideas is bursting at the seams, but you are very much encouraged to post topic suggestions here or on the
  <a href="https://putanumonit.com/full-archive/" target="_blank">
   Full Archive page
  </a>
  (finally updated). Feel free to also post shorter questions, I’d love to have enough to do a mailbag Q&amp;A.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the start of year 2 I am more committed than ever to keep writing, keep improving, and keep engaging with my readers. Thank you for sticking around.
