 f you’ve ever putzed around the internet, looking for why your relationships might all be screwed up (and screwed up in the same ways, I might add), then you’ve probably come across Attachment Theory.
</p>
<p>
 Attachment Theory is an area of psychology that describes the nature of emotional attachment between humans. It begins as children with our attachment to
 <a href="/parents" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  our parents
 </a>
 . The nature of this attachment, and how well it’s fostered and cared for, will then influence the nature of our attachment to
 <a href="/dating-relationships-course" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  romantic partners
 </a>
 later in our life.

 Attachment theory began in the 1950s and has since amassed a small mountain of research behind it. Two researchers, John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, found that the nature in which infants get their needs met by their parents significantly contributes to their “attachment strategy” throughout their lives.

 Your attachment style doesn’t explain everything about your relationships, but it probably explains a great deal of why your
 <a href="/relationship-advice" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  close relationships have succeeded/failed
 </a>
 in the manner they did, why you’re attracted to the
 <a href="/how-to-find-the-one" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  people you are attracted to
 </a>
 , and the nature of the
 <a href="/psycho" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  relationship problems
 </a>
 that come up again and again for you.
</p>
<p>
 According to psychologists, there are four attachment strategies adults can adopt: secure, anxious, avoidant, and anxious-avoidant.
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-3" id="refmark-3">

</p>
<p>
 People with secure attachment strategies are comfortable
 <a href="/vulnerability-in-relationships" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  displaying interest and affection
 </a>
 . They are also comfortable being alone and independent
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  , and display a healthy level of self-confidence
 </span>
 . They’re able to correctly prioritize their relationships within their life and tend to
 <a href="/boundaries" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  draw clear boundaries
 </a>
 and stick to them.
</p>
<p>
 Secure attachment types obviously make the best romantic partners, family members, and even friends. They’re capable of
 <a href="/how-to-break-up-with-someone" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  accepting rejection
 </a>
 and
 <a href="/how-to-get-over-someone" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  moving on despite the pain
 </a>
 , but are also capable of being loyal and sacrificing when necessary. They have little issue trusting people they’re close to and are trustworthy themselves.
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Secure types comfortably form intimate relationships not only with partners, but also with friends.
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  They have no trouble revealing themselves to and occasionally relying on others when the situation calls for it. And they are excellent caregivers.

 According to research, over 50% of the population are secure attachment types.

</p>
<p>
 Anxious attachment types are often nervous and stressed about their relationships. They need constant reassurance and affection from their partner. They have trouble being alone or single. They’ll often succumb to
 <a href="/toxic-relationship-signs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  unhealthy or abusive relationships
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Anxious types have trouble trusting people, even if they’re close to them,
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  yet excessively rely on others for their emotional needs and to resolve their problems
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  . Their behavior can be irrational, sporadic, and overly-emotional
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  . They’re the ones
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  complain
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  ing
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  that everyone of the opposite sex are cold and heartless.
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  And probably bursting into tears while doing so.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 This is the girl who calls you 36 times in one night wondering why you didn’t call her back
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  —let’s call her Anna
 </span>
 . Or the guy who follows his girlfriend to work to make sure she’s not flirting with any other men.
</p>
<p>
 Women are more likely to be anxious types than men,
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-6" id="refmark-6">
  <sup>
   6
  </sup>
 </a>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  but it’s okay, there’s still plenty of insecurity to go around.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 Avoidant attachment types are extremely independent, self-directed, and often uncomfortable with intimacy. They’re commitment-phobes and experts at rationalizing their way out of any intimate situation. They regularly complain about feeling “crowded” or “suffocated” when people try to get close to them.
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  They are often paranoid that others want to control them or box them in.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <img alt="Attachment Theory: Avoidant type" class="wp-image-16538 size-full alignright" data-src="https://markmanson.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/avoidant.png" height="300" loading="lazy" width="400"/>
</p>
<p>
 In every relationship, they always have an exit strategy. Always.
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Avoidants often construct their lifestyle in such a way to avoid commitment or too much intimate contact.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 In surveys, avoidant types score uniquely high on self-confidence and uniquely low on emotional expressiveness and warmth. They not only reveal themselves far less to their partner and friends, but also tend not to rely on others, even when they should. They score lower than other types as caregivers, meaning they’re not to be relied upon when in a pickle.
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-7" id="refmark-7">

  </sup>
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  It’s a sad fact that relationships tend to be controlled by those who care least. Therefore, avoidants tend to be the ones in control in both friendships and romantic relationships, as they are almost always willing to leave. This is opposed to anxious types, who let themselves be controlled in both.

</p>
<p>
 Men are more likely than women to be avoidant types,
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-9" id="refmark-9">
  <sup>

 </a>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  but as always, there’s plenty of neuroses to go around
 </span>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Anxious-avoidant attachment types (also known as the “fearful or disorganized type”) bring together the worst of both worlds. Anxious-avoidants are not only afraid of intimacy and commitment, but they distrust and lash out emotionally at anyone who tries to get close to them. Anxious-avoidants often spend much of their time alone and miserable, or in abusive or dysfunctional relationships.
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Anxious-avoidants are low in confidence and less likely to express emotions, preferring to suppress them.
  <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-10" id="refmark-10">
   <sup>
    10
   </sup>
  </a>
  However, they can have intense emotional outbursts when under stress.
  <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-11" id="refmark-11">
   <sup>
    11
   </sup>
  </a>
  They also don’t tend to seek help when in need due to a distrust of others. This sucks because they are also incapable of sorting through their own issues.
  <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-12" id="refmark-12">
   <sup>
    12
   </sup>
  </a>
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Anxious-avoidants really get the worst of both worlds. They avoid intimacy not because they prefer to be alone like avoidants. Rather, they avoid intimacy because they are so terrified of its potential to hurt them.
  <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-13" id="refmark-13">
   <sup>
    13
   </sup>
  </a>
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 According to studies, only a small percentage of the population qualifies as anxious-avoidant types, and they typically have a multitude of other emotional problems in other areas of their life (i.e., substance abuse, depression, etc.
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-14" id="refmark-14">
  <sup>
   14
  </sup>
 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 As with most psychological profiling, these types aren’t monolithic qualities, but scalar in nature and somewhat independent.
</p>
<p>
 For instance, according to the book
 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585429139/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=entsblo-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1585429139" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

 by Amir Levie and Rachel Heller, I scored about 75% on the secure scale, 90% on the avoidant scale, and 10% on the anxious scale. And my guess is that 3-5 years ago, the secure would have been lower and the anxious would have been higher, although my avoidant has always been solidly maxed out (as any of my ex-girlfriends will tell you).
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  The point is, you can exhibit tendencies of more than one strategy depending on the situation and at different frequencies. Although, everyone has one dominant strategy. So
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Secure Sarah
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  will still exhibit some avoidant or anxious behaviors,
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Anxious Anna
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  and Avoidant Alex
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  will sometimes exhibit secure behaviors, etc. It’s not all or nothing. But
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Anxious-avoidant Aaron
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  will score high on both anxious and avoidant types and low on the secure scale.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 Like I said previously, our attachment styles as adults are influenced by how we related to our parents (or one parent/primary caregiver) as young children. As helpless little babies, this is our first and most important relationship of our lives, so it naturally sets the “blueprint” for how we perceive all relationships as we mature.
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-15" id="refmark-15">
  <sup>
   15
  </sup>
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 We use this relationship blueprint as we age into late childhood and adolescence, when we typically start to form important relationships outside of our immediate relationship with our parent(s). Our peer group takes on a larger role in our lives as we continue to learn how to relate to others. These experiences further influence our attachment style as we eventually become romantically involved with others, which, in turn, also influence our attachment style.
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-16" id="refmark-16">
  <sup>
   16
  </sup>
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 So while your early experiences with your parent(s) do have a considerable influence on how you relate to others, it’s
 <a href="/parents" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  not the only factor
 </a>
 that determines your attachment style (though it’s a big one) and your attachment style can change over time (more on this later).
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Generally, though, secure attachment types regularly have their needs met as infants. They grew up feeling competent among their peers, but were also comfortable with their shortcomings to a degree. As a result, they exhibit healthy,
 </span>
 <a href="/boundaries" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   strong boundaries
  </span>
 </a>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  as adults, can communicate their needs well in their relationships, and
 </span>
 <a href="/when-to-break-up-with-someone" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   aren’t afraid to leave a bad one
  </span>
 </a>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  if they think they need to.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Anxious types, on the other hand, receive love and care with unpredictable sufficiency as infants. Growing up, they have positive views of their peers, but negative views of themselves. Their romantic relationships are often overly idealized and they rely too heavily on them for self-esteem. Hence the 36 calls in one night when you don’t pick up your phone.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Avoidants like Alex would have got only some of their needs met as infants, while the rest were neglected (for instance, Alex might have gotten fed regularly, but wasn’t held enough). So Alex grows up holding a negative view of others but a positive view of himself. He hasn’t depended too much on his romantic relationships for his needs and feels like he doesn’t need others for emotional support.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Anxious-avoidant Aaron, though, would have had an abusive or terribly negligent childhood. He grew up having a hard time relating to his peers. So as an adult, he seeks both intimacy and independence in romantic interactions, sometimes simultaneously, which, as you can imagine, doesn’t really go well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 Different attachment types tend to configure themselves into intimate relationships in predictable ways. Secure types are capable of dating (or handling, depending on your perspective) both anxious and avoidant types. They’re comfortable enough with themselves to give anxious types all of the reassurance they need and to give avoidant types the space they need without feeling threatened themselves.
</p>
<p>
 Anxious and avoidants frequently end up in relationships with one another more often than they end up in relationships with their own types.
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-17" id="refmark-17">
  <sup>
   17
  </sup>
 </a>
 That may seem counter-intuitive, but there’s order behind the madness. Avoidant types are so good at putting others off that oftentimes it’s only the anxious types who are willing to stick around and put in the extra effort to get them to open up.
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  For instance,
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Avoidant Alex
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  may be able to successfully shirk
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Secure Sarah
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  ’s pushes for increased intimacy. After which,
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Secure Sarah
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  will accept the rejection and move on. But
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Anxious Anna
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  will only become more determined by a man who pushes her away. She’ll resort to calling him for weeks or months on end until he finally caves and commits to her. This gives
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Avoidant Alex
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  the reassurance he needs that he can behave independently and
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Anxious Anna
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  will wait around for him.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 Often these relationships produce some degree of dysfunctional equilibrium as they fall into a pattern of chaser-chasee, which are both roles the anxious and avoidant types need in order to feel comfortable with intimacy.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 Anxious-avoidants only date each other or the least secure of the anxious types or avoidant types. These relationships are very messy, if not downright abusive or negligent.
</p>
<p>
 What all of this adds up to, which is the same conclusion I propose
 <a href="/books/models" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  in my book
 </a>
 , is that in relationships, insecurity finds insecurity and security finds security, even if those insecurities don’t always look the same.

 To put it bluntly, to everyone who has emailed me over the years complaining that all of the people they meet are insecure, or have trust issues, or are needy and manipulative… well, let’s just say
 <a href="/psycho" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  I have some bad news for you
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 If you don’t have an idea of what your attachment style is yet and want to take a test, you can take
 <a href="http://www.yourpersonality.net/attachment/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  this one
 </a>
 . It’s a great resource that will give you an idea of your attachment style across different relationships—parents, friends, romantic partners.
</p>
<p>
 I also really like it because you can track how various aspects of your attachment strategy change over time.
</p>
<p>
 If you don’t want to take the test (takes maybe 10 minutes), the gist of it is this: if you’re consistently avoiding commitment, avoiding your romantic partners, shutting them out, or not sharing things with them, then you’re probably pretty avoidant.
</p>
<p>
 If you’re constantly worrying about your partners, feel like they don’t like you as much as you like them, want to see them 24/7, need constant reassurance from them, then you’re probably anxious.
</p>
<p>
 If you’re comfortable dating people, being intimate with them and are able to draw
 <a href="/boundaries" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  clear boundaries in your relationships
 </a>
 , but also don’t mind being alone, then you’re probably secure.
</p>
<p>
 Note, however, that there are some individual differences in how strongly we might identify with each attachment style. For example, you might be securely attached in most areas but have some anxious or avoidant tendencies in other situations.
</p>
<p>
 That said, most people typically have a predominant attachment style they tend to fall back on in their close relationships.
</p>
<p>
 The good news is that your attachment style can change over time—although it’s slow and difficult.
</p>
<p>
 Research shows that an anxious or avoidant who enters a long-term relationship with a secure can be “raised up” to the level of the secure over an extended period of time. Unfortunately, an anxious or avoidant is also capable of “bringing down” a secure to their level of insecurity if they’re not careful.
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-19" id="refmark-19">
  <sup>

  </sup>
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 Also, extreme negative life events, such as divorce, death of child, serious accident, etc., can cause a secure attachment type to fall into a more insecure attachment type.

 If you’re beginning to think that anxious and/or avoidant behavior corresponds to the fake alpha syndrome and other insecure behavior I describe in men
 <a href="/books/models" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  in my book
 </a>
 , then you’re correct. Our attachment styles are intimately connected with our confidence in ourselves and others.
</p>
<p>
 Psychologists Bartholomew and Horowitz have hypothesized a model showing that one’s attachment strategy corresponds to the degree of positive/negative self-image, and the positive/negative image of others.

</p>
<p>
 Secures exhibit both positive self-images and positive perceptions of others. Anxious types exhibit negative self-images, but positive perceptions of others (hence their needy behavior).
</p>
<p>
 Avoidants exhibit positive self-images and negative perceptions of others (hence their arrogance and fear of commitment), and anxious-avoidants exhibit negative perceptions of just about everything and everyone (hence their inability to function in relationships).
</p>
<p>
 Using this model as a roadmap, one can begin to navigate oneself to a more secure attachment type.
</p>
<p>
 Anxious types can work on developing themselves, creating healthy boundaries and fostering a healthy self-image.
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Instead of constantly
 </span>
 <a href="/how-to-find-the-one" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">
   looking for “

   </span>
  </i>
 </a>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  who will magically solve all their problems (and then calling them 36 times in one night), they can look for things that will make them a better, healthier person both in body and mind.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  One of my most common pieces of dating advice is for men to find something they’re passionate about and good at and make that a focal point of their life rather than women.
 </span>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Needless to say, the same goes for women as well.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Once they’re content with who they are, anxious types can then work to become more aware of their tendency to seek partners that reaffirm their negative self-image.

  </a>
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 <span style="font-weight: 400;">
  Remember what I said about insecurity finding insecurity? Anxious types will do well to break out of that cycle and surround themselves with people, friends and lovers alike, who lift them up, rather than knock them down. And to deepen those relationships. The positive emotional experiences they get from healthy relationships, especially profound ones like with a spouse, will re-shape their view of the world, reduce their anxieties, and help mold them into more secure types.

  For the unlucky few who find themselves both anxious and avoidant, they can follow the advice for both types above. Focus on getting to know themselves, their fears and insecurities, embrace them, and

 And of course, some of you may be reading this and thinking, “I like being alone and being able to sleep with whoever I want. I wouldn’t change a thing.” And it’s true—many people lead happy, successful lives as avoidant or anxious types. Some even have successful

 relationships as an anxious or avoidant.

And I can unequivocally say that I’m happier and more fulfilled in my relationships and with the women I date now than I ever was back then.
