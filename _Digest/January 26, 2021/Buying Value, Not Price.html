    Shopping for Happiness
   </a>
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
  My old Galaxy smartphone recently gave up the ghost, and I upgraded to the new model for $750. My friend was surprised when I told him. The old model is now available for $250, is the new one really three times better?
 </p>
 <p>
  “Three times” better can mean several things, but in my post on spending money wisely I
  <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2016/05/11/shopping-for-happiness/#hedon" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   came up with the metric
  </a>
  that should guide purchasing decisions: happiness gained per unit of time spent experiencing a thing, or 😊/hr. By this metric, since the new phone costs 3x as much, unless it provides 3x the 😊/hr it’s worse in terms of $/😊. That means I’m getting less happiness per dollar spent.
 </p>
 <p>
  I like my new phone a lot: the screen is bigger, the battery lasts all day and night,
  <a href="https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/hotel-blogging.jpg?w=1800" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   I can use it for blogging
  </a>
  . It brings me at least 25% more 😊 than the old phone. But, it doesn’t make me 200% happier. And yet I feel like I’m getting a good deal.
 </p>
 <p>
  When my friend asked how I would justify this decision I warned him not to trust my explanation – since I already bought the phone, any justification may just be a post hoc rationalization. That caveat aside, my justification is that the price of the phone is a red herring. What I really care about is the
  <em>
   value
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Ask yourself: how much would you be willing to pay for your smartphone if it was the only model available for sale?
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether they
  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   “ruined a generation”
  </a>
  or not, but I think that smartphones are awesome and immensely improve my life. If I had to choose between no phone at all or a Galaxy smartphone, I’d pay at least $4,000 for the old model and $5,000 (25% more) for the new one. That means I’d be willing to pay $1,000 more for the upgrade, and they only charge me $500 more ($750 vs. $250) for it. The fact that smartphones cost less than what I’m willing to pay is just a wonderful bonus born of engineering ingenuity and market competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  I square this with the $/😊 disparity by noting that my goal is to maximize 😊 over all the money I spend, not in each category separately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Consider a toy example of a world in which only two product categories exist: jackets and smartphones. You have $1,000 to spend, and four products to choose from:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Galaxy S7, $250, 4,000 😊
  </li>
  <li>
   Galaxy Note 9, $750, 5,000 😊
  </li>
  <li>
   Regular jacket, $250, 500 😊
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="https://xkcd.com/90/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    Fucking jacket
   </a>
   , $750, 1,000 😊
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Given the constraint that you can only enjoy one smartphone at a time, the most happiness is bought by purchasing the Galaxy Note 9 and a regular jacket – 5,500 😊. The S7 does better in terms of $/😊 but it doesn’t leave you with great options for the remaining $750. It’s better to spend more on
  <em>
   categories
  </em>
  of products where you get a lot of 😊 and spend the minimum in low-value categories instead of looking to optimize
  <em>
   within
  </em>
  each category separately.
 </p>
 <p>
  This example is not too far from the real case for me. The fact that I’d be willing to pay ~10x the asking price for a smartphone is a sign that smartphones (along with
  <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2016/05/11/shopping-for-happiness/#comment-813" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   soap, tea, and underwear
  </a>
  ) are high-value categories. If I have enough money to buy great things in each of those I should do that before looking elsewhere. For things that I value little compared to their average price (cars, jewelry, whiskey) even a good within-category deal is a bad deal overall.
 </p>
 <h2>
  Decomposing Value
 </h2>
 <p>
  One more thing to consider is that the value of a purchase is made up of several factors.
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(marketing)" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   Marketing theory
  </a>
  usually breaks those into four types:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Functional value
   </strong>
   – the direct use of a thing, the problem it solves. The value of a spoon is mostly functional.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Social value
   </strong>
   – the connection with other people and the signaling value of the thing. The value of
   <a href="https://quillette.com/2018/06/03/bryan-caplans-case-education-review/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
    a college degree
   </a>
   is mostly social.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Psychological value
   </strong>
   – the happiness resulting from merely having the thing. The value of a framed family photo is mostly psychological.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Monetary value
    <em>
    </em>
   </strong>
   – the financial benefit generated by owning or reselling the thing. The value of stocks and bonds is mostly monetary.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Companies use this breakdown to market product to consumers, but as a consumer, you can flip this around to figure out what you’re looking for and how much it’s worth. For example, I can decompose the value of a tailored suit:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   $50 of functional value – keeping me warm and not-naked.
  </li>
  <li>
   $2,000 of social value – a requirement for certain jobs and social events.
  </li>
  <li>
   $300 of psychological value – I feel like I look good in it.
  </li>
  <li>
   0 monetary value – no one is going to pay much for a suit tailored to someone else.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  This means that I’d be willing to pay up to $2,350 for a good suit (thankfully, I can find one for a fraction of that price), but I won’t pay much extra for a suit that is slightly better looking for me or does a better job of keeping me warm – most of the suit’s value is social.
 </p>
 <p>
  In rich countries,
  <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2018/10/10/ubi-for-president/#hhe" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   people tend to spend a lot more money
  </a>
  on social value than on other kinds. Making me warm in New York costs a lot less than making me cool.
 </p>
 <p>
  For an opposite example, I almost always buy the
  <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2019/04/03/airportpourri/#overnight" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   cheapest overnight airline tickets
  </a>
  I can find, even if an airline with great food and service costs only 10% more. The value of a plane ticket to me is almost purely functional – getting me to another city. I don’t care to pay more than $15 for an in-flight meal, let alone hundreds of dollars for business class or more polite flight attendants.
 </p>
 <p>
  Advanced Putanumonit users don’t have to limit themselves to the four types of value described above. You can
  <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2017/03/12/goddess-spreadsheet/#attributes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   goal factor any purchase
  </a>
  and break it down to your personalized components of value. And after doing this exercise, truly advanced and enlightened users may decide not to spend their money
  <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2018/11/27/peanut-butter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   on anything except peanut butter
  </a>
  . Unfortunately, I’m not there yet.
