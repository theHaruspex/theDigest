 veryone has heard of therapy in some form or another, but a lot of people don’t have a clear idea of what it is or what they’re getting into. One stereotype is that you lay on a couch and cry like a child. Another is that it’s just some guy who prescribes you pills. Another is that it’s some guy who shows you ink blots and asks you what you see (boobs, I always see boobs). As with many things, these are caricatures created by pop culture for entertainment purposes. Most therapy is far duller and far more personal than this.

 The idea behind therapy is that most of our decision making comes from unconscious aspects of our mind. As long as these parts of our mind are unconscious, we’re unable to exercise control over them. The primary purpose of therapy is to help us

  become aware
 </a>
 of these sections of our unconscious, accept them and then begin exerting control over them. This is how you generally learn to take care of your daily

 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 For instance, if you get uncontrollably angry when your significant other doesn’t call back, there’s something buried within your unconscious causing you to react in such an irrational manner. By attending therapy, you can start digging into the past, your

 , life problems,

 , and find the trigger. Maybe your mother made a habit of leaving you behind when you were most vulnerable. Perhaps your relationship involved someone

 repeatedly or they were rarely available. Whatever. Once uncovered, then you can process the anger and the hurt in a safe environment. This will then allow you to become more aware of the anger and therefore not feel so powerless to these outbursts when they happen. Eventually, you should be able to exert enough

  control over the emotion
 </a>
 to modify your behavior.
</p>
<p>
 Another popular form of therapy is Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is useful for changing specific
 <a href="/downloads/habits-ebook" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  habits
 </a>
 or thought-patterns, particularly anxiety and depression. CBT focuses more on observing your thoughts and how they lead to behaviors rather than unconscious

 . Both forms of therapy have their own strengths and weaknesses. Both are quite effective depending on the issue.

 There are a lot of criticisms of therapy, and although most of them are made by people who have never actually attended therapy, some of them are legitimate. If you are considering therapy or are already in therapy, here are some things to watch out for:
</p>
<p>
 I’ve actually referred a lot people to therapy over the years. Many have ignored it (especially men…). Some have gone. A few have come back and thanked me for recommending it to them. It’s hard to say for sure who needs it and who doesn’t. Therapy is one of those tricky things, like most self-development tools, because it’s rarely ever a
 <em>
  bad
 </em>
 thing to do. One could argue that
 <em>
  everyone
 </em>
 needs therapy in some form or another or for some period of time. But I would only recommend it if you feel you aren’t able to handle your emotional issues on your own and have tried for a while.

 Here are some signs you may want to consider therapy:

 In the end, therapy is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, it could be the difference between a healthy and happy life and a life full of agonizing crapfests. I prefer the former myself.
