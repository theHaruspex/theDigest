  This is from today’s

   New York Times article on Elon Musk

  removed, the “filler words and transitions between ideas and thin veneer of argument”. You are not meant to read those anyway, they’re just there to hypnotically transition you between the affect-laden words I left in my summary.
 </p>
 <p>
  My summary is exactly 100 words long; the article itself is 1,500. Go ahead and read it. See if there’s a single bit of information in it that you couldn’t predict from my summary above. A single sentence that surprised you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please note also that this is not an op-ed, it’s in the news section. The author “covers tech and internet culture from San Francisco” — ostensibly a
  <em>
   reporter
  </em>
  , live on location. But there is no reporting in the article, only emotional affect. The goal is to make you feel, on a level below knowledge, that you should dislike Musk, Republicans, Tesla owners, online culture, and Silicon Valley.
 </p>
 <p>
  To sum up: the “tech and internet culture reporter” for the New York times is not reporting on tech and internet culture, but trying to hypnotize you into hating tech and internet culture.
 </p>
 <p>
  This article is posted once per week each on the New York Times, on Recode, on Wired, etc. Not “an article in this vein” but basically the same exact article with the same list of triggering words. What do incels have to do with Musk or Trump? Nothing, except that you need to be reminded weekly to hate all three. If you only hate one of them, the association will be hammered into your mind until you can’t tell them apart.
 </p>
 <p>
  But really, no one even reads the article — all the fnords are exhausting and make the reader uncomfortable. Here’s the Times’ summary of the article in a

 <p>
  That’s it, just one clean sentence that starts with “Tesla” and ends with “racist”. Perfection.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are also other words in that sentence, words like “connotations”, “reference” and “discussed”. These words actually give away the game, they’re literally an admission that the author isn’t reporting on any particular racism exhibited by Musk or Tesla but is merely tying them together with a ribbon of semantics and association. But it’s OK, no one reads those words anyway, not in a sentence that has Musk and misogyny and scare quotes in it.

 <p>
  The year is 2036. President Ivanka Trump congratulates Elon Musk on landing the first human mission on Mars. The New York Times reports:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   SpaceX trillionaire hypocrisy wealth.
  </p>
  <p>
   Trump Musk Trump Musk Trump Musk COVID-34.
  </p>
  <p>
   Misogynist racist Silicon Valley speciesist antimortist.

  I wish there was some convenient metaphor for suddenly seeing through this naked narrative manipulation, like a thing that opens your eyes to a larger truth or something. Maybe there was a movie with a similar idea? Gosh, I can’t remember now.
