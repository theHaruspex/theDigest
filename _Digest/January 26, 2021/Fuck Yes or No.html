 hink about this for a moment: Why would you ever choose to be with someone who is not excited to be with you?
</p>
<p>
 There’s a grey area in dating many people get hung up on — a grey area where feelings are ambiguous or one person has stronger feelings than the other. This grey area causes real, tangible issues.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  “She said she’s not interested, but she still flirts with me, so what do I need to do to get her?”
 </em>
 <br/>
 <em>
  “Well, I know she likes me, but she didn’t call me back last weekend, what should I do?”
 </em>
 <br/>
 <em>
  “He treats me well when he’s around, but he’s hardly around. What does that mean?”
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Most dating advice exists to “solve” this grey area for people. Say this line. Text her this. Call him this many times. Wear that.
</p>
<p>
 Much of it gets exceedingly analytical, to the point where some men and women actually spend more time analyzing behaviors than actually, you know, behaving.
</p>
<p>
 Frustration with this grey area also drives many people to unnecessary manipulation, drama and game-playing — like “forgetting” a jacket at her place so she’ll have to call you again, or “making” him wait until he’s taken you on three dates before you’ll sleep with him.
</p>
<p>
 These things may seem clever, exciting, even logical to some people who are stuck or frustrated. But this dating advice misses the point.
 <strong>
  If you’re in the grey area to begin with, you’ve already lost.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Let me ask again: Why would you ever be excited to be with someone who is not excited to be with you? If they’re not happy with you now, what makes you think they’ll be happy to be with you later? Why do you make an effort to convince someone to date you when they make no effort to convince you?
</p>
<p>
 What does that say about you? That you believe you need to
 <em>
  convince
 </em>
 people to be with you? (Hint: it implies that you wouldn’t even want to be with yourself.)
</p>
<p>
 You wouldn’t buy a dog that bites you all the time. You wouldn’t be friends with someone who regularly ditches you. And you wouldn’t work a job that doesn’t pay you. Then why the hell are you trying to make a girlfriend out of a woman who doesn’t want to date you? Where’s your fucking self-respect?
</p>

 The entrepreneur Derek Sivers once wrote a
 <a href="http://sivers.org/hellyeah" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  blog post
 </a>
 where he said, “If I’m not saying ‘Hell Yeah!’ to something, then I say no.” It served him well in the business world and now I’d like to apply it to the dating world. And because I’m more of a vulgar asshole than Derek is, I’ll christen mine
 <em>
  The Law of Fuck Yes or No.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  The Law of Fuck Yes or No
 </em>
 also states that when you want to get involved with someone new, in whatever capacity, THEY must also respond with a “Fuck Yes” in order for you to proceed with them.
</p>
<p>
 As you can see,
 <em>
  The Law of Fuck Yes or No
 </em>
 implies that
 <em>
  both
 </em>
 parties must be enthusiastic about the prospect of one another’s company. Why?
</p>
<p>
 Because attractive,
 <a href="/books/models" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  non-needy
 </a>
 , high self-worth people don’t have time for people who they are not excited to be with and who are not excited to be with them. Fuck yeah.
</p>
<p>
 This may sound a bit idealistic to some. But
 <em>
  The Law of Fuck Yes or No
 </em>
 has many tangible benefits on your dating life:
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  The Law of Fuck Yes or No
 </em>
 is applicable to dating, sex,
 <a href="/healthy-relationship-habits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  relationships
 </a>
 , even friendships. You may have absolutely nothing in common with that bartender. But they’re hot and are interested in getting down. Is it a “Fuck Yes!” for sex? It is? Then game on.
</p>
<p>
 Wrapped up in that sweet guy who treats you so well, except goes weeks without calling you and suddenly disappears after a couple drinks and a round of the horizontal polka? Been wondering if he really likes you? Do his excuses of being so busy all the time seem legit? It doesn’t sound like the answer is a “Fuck yes.” Then it’s time to move on.
</p>
<p>
 Making out with a girl at your house and every time you go to take her shirt off she swats your hands away? That is not a “Fuck Yes,” my friend, therefore, it is a no and you shouldn’t pressure her. The best sex is “Fuck Yes” sex — i.e., both people are shouting “Fuck Yes” as they hop between the sheets together. If she’s not hopping, then there’s no fucking.
</p>
<p>
 (Hint Fellas: This is a great time to ask the girl why she’s not comfortable, and what she’s looking for from you. That, by itself — you know, treating her like a human and empathizing with her — often creates a lot more clarity going forward.)
</p>
<p>
 Want to date that woman you met last weekend but she keeps ignoring your texts and calls? Not sure what to say or do, especially since she seemed so happy to go out with you when you initially met her? Well, my friend, this is obviously not a “Fuck Yes.” Therefore, it is a “No.” Delete her number and move on.
</p>
<p>
 Fuck Yes or No
 <a href="/how-to-find-the-one" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  applies to relationships as well
 </a>
 . My wife used to work with a guy who got married because
 <a href="/reasons-to-get-married" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  “it seemed like the right thing to do.”
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 You do your taxes because “it’s seems like the right thing to do.” You wipe your infant’s ass because “it seems like the right thing to do.” You don’t marry someone because “it seems like the right thing to do.” You marry them because you can’t fucking imagine ever not wanting to be with them.
</p>
<p>
 Unsurprisingly, four years later, he was
 <a href="/why-people-cheat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  cheating
 </a>
 on his wife every chance he got. The marriage was not a “Fuck Yes” for him. It should have been a “No” from Day 1.
</p>
<p>
 Sometimes
 <em>
  The Law of Fuck Yes or No
 </em>
 will apply differently on different levels. You may be a “Fuck Yes” for friendship with someone, but mildly excited to have sex with them. Therefore, it’s a no. You may be a “Fuck Yes” on banging someone’s brains out, but a definite “No” on actually spending any time with them. Apply the law to your decision-making as it suits your needs.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  The Law of Fuck Yes or No
 </em>
 doesn’t necessarily mean you have to be falling in knee-wobbling love at first sight. It doesn’t even mean you have to be completely convinced that someone is right for you. You can be “Fuck Yes” about getting to know someone better. You can be “Fuck Yes” about seeing someone again because you think there’s something there. You can be “Fuck Yes” about giving things a few months to pan out and see if you can fix the problems in the
 <a href="/healthy-relationship-habits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  relationship
 </a>
 . You can be “Fuck Yes” about sticking it out in an unhappy relationship because you can see the long-term potential in the future.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  The point is: both you and the other person need to be fuck yes about
  <em>
   something
  </em>
  (and it must be the same thing), otherwise you’re just wasting your time.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 But the real beauty of
 <em>
  The Law of “Fuck Yes or No”
 </em>
 is that it simplifies the problems you can have in your dating life. When applying the
 <em>
  Law of “Fuck Yes or No,”
 </em>
 there are really only two problems one can have.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  The first problem is people who never feel a “Fuck Yes” for anybody they meet.
 </strong>
 If you are lukewarm on absolutely everyone you meet, then either your demographics are way off, or you suffer from a lack of
 <a href="/vulnerability" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  vulnerability
 </a>
 and are protecting yourself by remaining indifferent and unenthused by all of those around you.
</p>
<p>
 Remember, it’s your job to look for something cool in everyone you meet; it’s not their job to show you. This is life, not a fucking sales convention. Learning to appreciate people you meet is a skill you cultivate. So
 <a href="/connection" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  get on it
 </a>
 . This doesn’t mean you have to fall in love with everyone who breathes in your direction. It just means you need to take responsibility for
 <a href="/courses/connection-course" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  your ability to connect with the people
 </a>
 you are meeting.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  The second problem is people who never meet others who feel a “Fuck Yes” for them.
 </strong>
 If all of the people you pursue give you a mild response or outright rejections, then it’s time to focus on improving yourself. Ask yourself, what is it about yourself that would inspire others to say “Fuck Yes” about you? If the answer is not obvious, then you get to work. Build yourself into a person others would say “Fuck Yes” to.
</p>
<p>
 And this is the ultimate dating advice lesson — man, woman, gay, straight, trans, furry, whatever — the only real dating advice is
 <a href="/self-improvement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  self-improvement
 </a>
 . Everything else is a distraction, a futile battle in the grey area, a prolonged ego trip. Because, yes, with the right tools and performance, you may be able to con somebody into sleeping with you, dating you, even marrying you. But you will have won the battle by sacrificing the war, the war of long-term happiness.
