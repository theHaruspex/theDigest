 ’ve got a friend who used to proudly proclaim he was a perfectionist every chance he got. He took pride in it. If something in his immediate environment wasn’t “right,” he would set out to fix it, almost reflexively. He had incredibly high standards for what he considered acceptable, both for the people around him and especially for himself. It made him good at what he did. But it could also make him kind of a dick.
</p>
<p>
 He knew he could be hard on himself, but he always said it was because he wanted to be better. And if he was hard on other people, he said he did it from a place of love. He wanted to see the people he cared about do well in life.
</p>
<p>
 But there was a catch with my friend: for someone who was always prattling on about holding himself to high standards, and wanting to achieve excellence, blah, blah, blah — he actually

 .
</p>
<p>
 He’d work on projects for months at a time without showing it to anyone because it wasn’t “done yet” — that is, it wasn’t perfect. He’d end up abandoning virtually every one of these projects, and I eventually realized it was because he’d reach a point where he realized it could never live up to what he had envisioned in his mind, which was, of course, perfection.
</p>
<p>
 He’d beat himself up for weeks, months, even years, either for not following through or for being so stupid to start something that wouldn’t “work” in the first place. Years of his life went by in a steady stream of intentions and planning and progress, without a single result.
</p>
<p>
 That’s where his perfectionism got him.
