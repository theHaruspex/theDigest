 <h2>
  Minority Retort
 </h2>
 <p>
  I made a claim in
  <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2016/11/23/climbing-the-horseshoe/" target="_blank">
   Climbing the Horseshoe
  </a>
  that
  <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/o5n/polarization_is_the_problem_normalization_is_the/dhv4" target="_blank">
   even Sarah Constantin misunderstood
  </a>
  , which means that I wrote it poorly. I’ll try to spell it out again, and set it apart from other arguments.
 </p>
 <p>
  My point was that it’s important to recognize when you’re holding an unpopular opinion and to change your tactics accordingly. Even if
  <em>
   normatively
  </em>
  you are right and everyone is wrong,
  <em>
   instrumentally
  </em>
  you should pursue your goals one way if 5% share your goals and worldview and another way if 80% do. For example, shaming others and calling them names (e.g.
  <em>
   bigot
  </em>
  or
  <em>
   traitor)
  </em>
  works (sometimes) if you’re part of the majority and doesn’t work if you’re part of the fringe.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if your entire social circle shares your views, you have to be cognizant of the amount of support your position has in the broad public. It’s not quite what
  <em>
   <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Outside_view" target="_blank">
    outside view
   </a>
  </em>
  is, but it requires a similar mental process of stepping outside your immediate surroundings. Here are a couple of examples from my own life:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2016/08/23/conversation-with-god/" target="_blank">
    I’m an atheist
   </a>
   , and many of my friends are atheist, but I realize that on a
   <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/" target="_blank">
    national scale
   </a>
   atheists are a tiny minority (~4%). If I want to promote atheism, I should be able to tell the difference between ardent religious zealots and the median American who believes in God and goes to church every other week but isn’t
   <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2d/talking_snakes_a_cautionary_tale/" target="_blank">
    a talking snake-ist
   </a>
   . When I talk with the latter about atheism, I politely explain for example how an atheist can share the intuition that murder is wrong with a holy book. I don’t tell anyone who believes in a deity that they’re a deluded fanatic.
  </li>
  <li>
   I’m a
   <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/08/a-something-sort-of-like-left-libertarianism-ist-manifesto/" target="_blank">
    left-libertarian
   </a>
   , and I
   <a href="https://niskanencenter.org/blog/cant-make-government-smaller/" target="_blank">
    engage intellectually
   </a>
   with many
   <a href="https://medium.com/@s8mb/im-a-neoliberal-maybe-you-are-too-b809a2a588d6#.dquvrg48j" target="_blank">
    left libertarians
   </a>
   . For example, I think that regardless of how much welfare we have raising the minimum wage will hurt the poor because it dminishesthe employability of the
   <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm" target="_blank">
    102 million adult Americans
   </a>
   who don’t have a job
   <em>
    and
   </em>
   increases the prices they pay. I also think that regardless of where the minimum wage is, we should have more unconditional welfare to help the poor (whether food stamps or
   <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2016/04/27/more-power-less-poverty/" target="_blank">
    basic income
   </a>
   ). And yet, I’m aware that “abolish the minimum wage but raise taxes to implement basic income” is an
   <em>
    extreme
   </em>
   position. When I talk to liberals about the minimum wage or to conservatives about welfare I try to gently convince them with stats and numbers, I don’t call them heartless monsters who hate the poor.
  </li>
  <li>
   On the other hand, homophobia has finally become a minority position and it’s not counterproductive to shame homophobes.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  This seems like common sense to me – you fight differently when you’re outnumbered than when you’re dominating. I thought it would be obvious
  <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2016/11/23/climbing-the-horseshoe/" target="_blank">
   for example to Jamelle Bouie
  </a>
  that calling the NY Times racist for encouraging dialogue with Trump voters is a minority opinion.
 </p>
 <p>
  It may not have been obvious at all.

  No True Liberal
 </h2>
 <p>
  A Facebook friend of mine shared the NY Times op-ed “
  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/opinion/liberal-zionism-in-the-age-of-trump.html?_r=0" target="_blank">
   Liberal Zionism in the Age of Trump
  </a>
  “.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Consider Hillary Clinton’s words from the second presidential debate: “It is important for us as a policy not to say, as Donald has said, we’re going to ban people based on a religion.” […] Here Clinton establishes a minimum standard of liberal decency that few American Jews would be inclined to deny. […] Yet insofar as Israel is concerned,
   <strong>
    every liberal Zionist has not just tolerated the denial of this minimum liberal standard
   </strong>
   , but avowed this denial as core to their innermost convictions. Whereas liberalism depends on the idea that states must remain neutral on matters of religion and race, Zionism consists in the idea that the State of Israel is not Israeli, but Jewish.
  </p>
  <p>
   […]
  </p>
  <p>
   Palestinians in fact do not demand a “right of return” to their pre-1967 homes, but to their pre-1948 homes. In other words, the issue isn’t the occupation, which many liberal Zionists agree is a crime, but Zionism itself. Opposition to the Palestinians’ “right of return”
   <strong>
    is a matter of consensus
   </strong>
   among left and right Zionists because also liberal Zionists insist that Israel has the right to ensure that Jews constitute the ethnic majority in
   <em>
    their
   </em>
   country.
   <br/>
   […]
   <br/>
   The following years promise to present American Jewry with a decision that they have much preferred to avoid. Hold fast to their liberal tradition, as the only way to secure human, citizen and Jewish rights; or embrace the principles driving Zionism.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="story-body-text story-content">
  The article explicitly states that opposing the right of Palestinians to move to Israel proper (right of return) is beneath a minimum standard of liberal decency, and thus Zionism is
  <strong>
   incompatible
  </strong>
  with liberalism. I commented that regardless of your
  <em>
   normative
  </em>
  opinion on Zionism, the right of return,
  <em>
   as a matter of fact
  </em>
  , has very little support among Jews. The article itself agrees that this is a consensus. Israel has 4 million more Jewish citizens than Muslim citizens, allowing 5 million Palestinian refugees to immigrate will immediately end Jewish majority in Israel and the character of the country as we know it. Even if one thinks that it’s the moral thing to do, it’s a very unpopular opinion among Jews, on par with the percentage of Americans who would be in favor of allowing 300 million Muslim immigrants into the US.
 </p>
 <p>
  I wrote that if you present Jews with the dilemma of accepting the right of return or not being a “liberal”, this sort of “liberalism” will not attract many Jews. This is the immediate response I got:

  Hey, math is hard, I get it.

  Inflated Bubbles
 </h2>
 <p>
  Why did these
  <em>
   liberals
  </em>
  react so venomously to the suggestion that I’m more liberal than the average American? Why do they think that rationalists, a group of strange but certainly left-of-center people, are enemies of liberalism?
 </p>
 <p>
  My first hypothesis was that they’re trying to make their ideas unpopular on purpose, by insulting and bullying outsiders who try to engage with them. Collectively this makes “liberalism” lose, but individually they gain status by signalling the extremity of their faith in the true cause. I wondered if
  <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2016/11/23/climbing-the-horseshoe/" target="_blank">
   Mr. Bouie doesn’t mind
  </a>
  that his tactics are counterproductive to fighting racism, I would wager that
  <em>
   Slate
  </em>
  ‘s ratings are higher with Trump in office than they would have been had Clinton won.
 </p>
 <p>
  I realized that this is too cynical.
  <em>
   Organizations
  </em>
  never solve the problem they were created to solve (as that would put the organization out of work), but it’s hard for people to be so explicitly hypocritical. It’s easier to convince others that you’re a fighter for liberalism / against racism if you actually believe this as well. I had to admit that these people really believed that they
  <em>
   are
  </em>
  helping the spread of liberalism as they see it.
 </p>
 <p>
  My second hypothesis is this:
 </p>
 <p class="rules">
  <strong>
   Theory of inflated bubbles
  </strong>
  – When your ideological bubble becomes small and tight enough, you start thinking that almost everyone outside the bubble agrees with you. In your mind, your bubble has inflated to encompass the entire world.
 </p>
 <p>
  I work hard to make holes in the bubbles I live in. I have neoreactionary friends, Marxist friends, anti-Semitic friends and apparently a friend who thinks that rationalists are villainous freaks. I engage all the time with people who strongly disagree with me, I know that they’re out there in great numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  But once you slide down the horseshoe into extremism and attack anyone who disagrees with you, the heretics to your worldview
  <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/lr/evaporative_cooling_of_group_beliefs/" target="_blank">
   evaporate out of your bubble
  </a>
  . If you live in a very liberal city (these three guys are from D.C., New York and Silicon Valley), consume very liberal media, and tell everyone who isn’t very liberal to choke on a dick, your
  <em>
   entire world
  </em>
  becomes exclusively made up of very liberal people. All perspective is lost.
  <span style="color:#993300;">
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic" style="color:#993300;" target="_blank">
    Availability bias
   </a>
  </span>
  and
  <span style="color:#993300;">
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias" style="color:#993300;" target="_blank">
    confirmation bias
   </a>
  </span>
  will then work tirelessly to convince you that those who disagree with you are an extremist fringe minority.
 </p>
 <p>
  If  you think that the NY Times or Bay Area rationalists are terribly bigoted, you will start thinking that the NY Times and the rationalists are part of the conservative minority even thought they’re both more liberal than the vast majority of the United States. No one can handle the
  <span style="color:#993300;">
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance" style="color:#993300;" target="_blank">
    cognitive dissonance
   </a>
  </span>
  of imagining that they live in a world that is 90% monster.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a self-reinforcing phenomenon: you think that those who disagree with you are a small minority and thus their views are extreme, and if their views are extreme they must be a  small minority.
 </p>
 <p>
  This explains why so many leftists blame this election on the alt-right (who are a tiny minority on the right that most Trump voters don’t care about) and rightists blamed Obama on groups like liberal university professors (who are a tiny minority on the left that most Obama voters don’t care about). They believe that anyone who voted against them is part of a small cult that somehow got lucky. How can merely
  <strong>
   losing an election
  </strong>
  convince anyone that they’re a minority when three of the
  <span style="color:#993300;">
   fiercest biases
  </span>
  a brain can employ work to convince them otherwise?
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
  This is a half-baked hypothesis. I don’t know how likely it is to be true (that many extremists think the majority agrees with them) and how to precisely define the phenomenon. It’s not charitable and it’s not scientific and it’s very condescending. But, it really makes a lot of what I’ve been seeing since the election make a lot more sense.
 </p>
 <p>
  The only question that remains is: what crazy ideas do
  <em>
   I
  </em>
  hold that I deludedly think most people agree with? I hope it’s not my faith that every human has the capacity for reason and kindness.
