  Two birds with one stack
 </h2>
 <p>
  As my long term readers know, there are two world-changing causes I am passionate about:
  <span style="color:#008000;">
   <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2015/12/07/008-water/" rel="noopener" style="color:#008000;" target="_blank">
    donating to the global poor
   </a>
  </span>
  and
  <span style="color:#008000;">
   <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2016/04/17/022-power_skeptic/" rel="noopener" style="color:#008000;" target="_blank">
    increasing sample sizes in RCT studies
   </a>
  </span>
  . In my wildest dreams I dared to imagine lifting people out of poverty while simultaneously decreasing error bars. That opportunity has arrived:
  <span style="color:#008000;">
   <a href="https://givedirectly.org/basic-income" rel="noopener" style="color:#008000;" target="_blank">
    GiveDirectly is planning a decade-long trial of guaranteed basic income in Kenya
   </a>
  </span>
  . I hope to inspire you to donate money to this groundbreaking project, and I
  <del>
   pledge to match
   <em>
    at least
   </em>
   the first $1000 donated by Putanumonit readers
  </del>
  <span style="color:#008000;">
   <strong>
    <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2016/05/03/poverty-donation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
     donated $2,182, and my readers more than $10,000
    </a>
   </strong>
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m going to argue that:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   People living in Kenyan slums can buy much more direct happiness per dollar than you or I.
  </li>
  <li>
   Research shows that you and I will be happier ourselves for donating the money to really poor people.
  </li>
  <li>
   Basic Income Guarantee (
   <strong>
    BIG
   </strong>
   )
   <em>
    could be
   </em>
   the best way to promote equality, prosperity and freedom in rich countries like the US.
  </li>
  <li>
   Or, BIG could be a terrible idea, but not for all reasons brought up by people who oppose BIG politically. In any case, we need a large-scale high quality trial of long-term universal income to find out what the consequences of BIG are.
  </li>
  <li>
   GiveDirectly is great at both getting the money to people who need it
   <em>
    and
   </em>
   at producing high-quality research.
  </li>
  <li>
   Either poverty alleviation or basic income research would be enough reason by themselves to donate. An opportunity to do both at the same time is reason to donate
   <strong>
    now
   </strong>
   , donate a
   <strong>
    lot
   </strong>
   , and donate

    in the richest 3% of world population
   </a>
  </span>
  . This category includes me and my friends. In spite of our affluence, sometimes things suck in our lives:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The Wi-Fi is slow.
  </li>
  <li>
   There’s no good Sushi in the neighborhood.
  </li>
  <li>
   The soccer game is cancelled because of rain.
  </li>
  <li>
   I run out of toilet paper.
  </li>
  <li>
   Happy hour ends before I leave work.
  </li>
  <li>
   Charged $150 copay by the health insurance.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The poorest 3% of the world earn $100 a year. Here are some things that suck in their life:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   There’s no electricity in the village.
  </li>
  <li>
   The daily meal is either ground maize paste or nothing.
  </li>

   When it rains everyone gets wet because the roof is made of grass.

  <span style="color:#008000;">
   <a href="https://givedirectly.org/research-on-cash-transfers" rel="noopener" style="color:#008000;" target="_blank">
    a bunch of research papers show
   </a>
  </span>
  that poor people receiving cash transfers don’t spend any more on alcohol or other “temptation goods”. Instead, they mostly spend it on better food, save up for medical emergencies and buy productive assets like metal sheets (used to rebuild homes and replace roofs) and goats (
  <span style="color:#008000;">
   <a href="http://www.largeup.com/2014/04/22/tuesday-in-tobago-goat-and-crab-racing-in-buccoo/" rel="noopener" style="color:#008000;" target="_blank">
    probably used for racing
   </a>
  </span>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  The best returns are achieved when cash transfers are given to the young and unemployed. These are people who are earning much less that their potential their entire lives because they have no cash to jump-start their careers and no access to credit given that they have no income.
  <span style="color:#008000;">
   <a href="http://cega.berkeley.edu/assets/cega_events/53/WGAPE_Sp2013_Blattman.pdf" rel="noopener" style="color:#008000;" target="_blank">
    Young people receiving $400 each in Uganda got an average return of 40% in a year on the money by buying training and tools for vocations like carpentry, tailoring and hairstyling
   </a>
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, there are lot of organizations that donate things like livestock or training directly, but they add huge overhead costs and remove personal choice and dignity. There is no real evidence that people in poor countries make bad choices about spending direct transfers.
 </p>
 <p>
  You know what? I spent $14 last week on flowers that my girlfriend turned out to be very allergic to and $32 on a Swiss knife that was promptly confiscated by the TSA when I forgot it in my travel backpack. Whatever the world’s poorest people choose to spend money on, they probably get more out of every dollar.

  3. Give Me Freedom or Give Me Death (and Taxes)

 <p>
  We’ll leave Kenya aside for the moment and land back in the USA for the next couple of sections. The American governments spends about $3,000 a year per person (

  No one supports adding BIG to the current mess of welfare, subsidies and entitlements. Libertarian advocates imagine a possible amendment to the constitution, perhaps something like this:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   <span style="color:#333399;">
    Henceforth, federal, state, and local governments shall make no law nor establish any program that provides benefits to some citizens but not to others. All programs currently providing such benefits are to be terminated. The funds formerly allocated to them are to be used instead to provide every citizen with an equal and unconditional cash grant from the age of majority until death.
   </span>
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  I feel the harm done to be by the US government in confusion, fear, frustration and constriction of my liberty, not just in dollars out of my pocket. If every upper middle class American made 20% less in after-tax income, our standard of living would
  <em>
   at worst
  </em>
  dip to the level of Canada or Belgium and
  <em>
   at best
  </em>
  <em>
   wouldn’t change at all
  </em>
  because the

  we spend our money on like houses in good neighborhoods, Ivy League degrees, Chanel bags and organic kale will just become 20% cheaper.
 </p>
 <p>
  In contrast, removing even a few of the current destructive policies will make me much happier and reduce the government’s ability to harass me. This is why most existing governments are strongly opposed to BIG.

  ? I’m writing this section at 3:06 pm on a Tuesday, guess where I’m sitting right now. If work creates prosperity, here’s a wild idea –
  <em>
   let’s f%&amp;#ng measure prosperity directly. O
  </em>
  r wealth, or wellbeing, or progress, or innovation, and
  <em>
   not the f@*%ing unemployment rate
  </em>
  . And if work is so indispensable to people’s self esteem and happiness,
  <em>
   why the f$!@ are we worried
  </em>
  that giving them a meager check will prevent them from working?
 </p>
 <p>
  To be honest, I don’t even mind my own job that much. The opportunity to pursue an interesting and rewarding career is the result of effort (studying math), planning (a degree in math) and a lot of luck (my parents are really good at math and gave me math genes and math textbooks). It’s a privilege. My company sells software to big corporations who use it for tasks that are normally done by college educated people with slightly above average IQ. With time, there are going to be fewer and fewer jobs for these people and for everyone less skilled than them. The reason that I’m not worried about robots taking
  <em>
   my
  </em>
  job isn’t that computers can’t be smart enough to write good software, it’s that once they
  <em>
   are
  </em>
  smart enough, humanity has

    about 5 minutes
   </a>
  </span>
  to worry about things like employment.
 </p>
 <p>
  If the only workplace I was qualified for was McDonald’s, I would prefer to sit at home collecting a BIG check and playing
  <span style="color:#008000;">
   <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain" rel="noopener" style="color:#008000;" target="_blank">
    Metal Gear Solid V
   </a>
  </span>
  while McDonald’s figures out at its leisure how much my labor as a burger-flipper is worth to them in a free market. The only thing worse than flipping burgers at a McDonald’s is being
  <span style="color:#008000;">
   <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/07/tech-company-develops-robots-to-replace-15-hr-workers-can-produce-1-burger-every-10-seconds/" rel="noopener" style="color:#008000;" target="_blank">
    replaced by a robot after the government unilaterally imposes burger-flipper wage limits
   </a>
  </span>
  on McDonald’s while claiming to help you.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the way, evidence shows that receiving money decreases working hours either

 </p>
 <p>
  I don’t even intend to argue that minimum wage laws are harmful, I think it’s likely but far from certain. In any case I’m a humble blogger and not a labor economist. My argument is that every single
  <em>
   existing
  </em>
  government policy has many intended and unintended consequences, both known and
  <em>
   unknown
  </em>
  . Claiming that a proposed policy could have unpredictable consequences in a general sense is no argument at all against.
 </p>
 <p>
  Thinking about predictable and harmful consequences
  <em>
   is
  </em>
  a good argument. Here are some actual reasons to worry that BIG
  <em>
   could
  </em>
  turn out to be a terrible idea:

 <p>
  There is no reason to suppose that an organization that is good at transferring cash to poor people very well will also do research well, but that seems to be true of GiveDirectly.

  Neither GiveDirectly nor Banerjee have long histories of advocating for basic income and both have strong reputations to protect independent of whether BIG is a success of a failure. Everyone involved probably hopes to find that BIG is the best thing since giving poor people sliced bread, but I am fairly confident that the research will be conducted objectively. Most importantly,
  <span style="color:#008000;">

  </span>
  to convince me that someone is planning to do rigorous and honest research.
 </p>
 <p>
  GiveWell has the track record in both cash transfers and research, now they just need our money. For every $1,000 we donate, our money will pull a person out of the worst poverty for at least a decade and increase by 1 the sample size of an experiment that could change the world for rich and poor alike.

 <h2>
  Let’s Do It
 </h2>
 <p>
  Here are the possible outcomes of the GiveDirectly basic income pilot:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Worst case
  </strong>
  – The research is flawed/inconclusive, the recipients spend the money on food and get a temporary reprieve from hunger.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Better case
  </strong>
  – The research shows that BIG is no better than conditional transfers and normal welfare, the recipients invest the money at high returns (goats) and some of them escape crushing poverty forever.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Best case
  </strong>
  – BIG is proven to improve outcomes (health, security, income, education, aspirations, productivity) across the board, inspires people in rich countries to stop making it complicated and solve poverty and inequality by simply giving everyone money.
