  I’m excited to announce

   Predictable Identities
  </a>
  , a weekly blogchain I am writing for Ribbonfarm. The links to the posts in the chain will go here:
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/20/predictable-identities-1/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   1: Guess What’s Coming
  </a>
  – Our brains are constantly trying to predict incoming signals, like the words you’ll encounter in this post.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/27/predictable-identities-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   2: Active Inference
  </a>
  – We predict the world to act on the world, and the most important component of the world to act on are people.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/10/predictable-identities-3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   3: Prisoner’s Dilemma
  </a>
  – If everything is game theory, what’s the optimal strategy?
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/13/predictable-identities-4/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   4: Stereotypes
  </a>
  – We did not evolve to predict faraway strangers. Thankfully, we’ve got stereotypes to help with that.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/03/20/predictable-identities-5/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   5: Outgroup Homogeneity
  </a>
  – You don’t need a detailed model of someone you can’t cooperate with.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/04/03/predictable-identities-6/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   6: Creeps
  </a>
  –  We like predictable people who fit a model we have. When someone’s behavior is incongruent and ambiguous, it creeps us out.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/04/24/predictable-identities-7-weirdness-budget/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   7: Weirdness Budget
  </a>
  – Groups need us to conform to group norms, and to who we were yesterday. We are granted a limited budget of nonconformity before the effort of modeling us is not worth the group’s effort.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/04/17/predictable-identities-7-roles-people-play/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   8: Roles People Play
  </a>
  – The social web likes us to stick to our roles, and it has the power to enforce its will.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/05/08/predictable-identities-9-how-to-change/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   9: How to Change
  </a>
  – How to change in a social web that hates change? Power through, leverage tropes, or just try someplace new.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/05/22/predictable-identities-10-big-updates/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   10: Big Updates
  </a>
  – How does changing your mind feel like? That depends on the scaffolding of belief you have in place.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/06/06/predictable-identities-10-fear-myths-and-the-outgroup-part-i/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   11: Fear, Myths and the Outgroup, Part I
  </a>
  – How fear of the unknown controls our reactions to new environments, motivates group aggression, and prevents us from learning and adapting (part 1 of 2).
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/06/26/predictable-identities-12-fear-myths-and-the-outgroup-part-ii/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   12: Fear, Myths, and the Outgroup, Part II
  </a>
  – Confirmation extortion and moral elimination: people anxious about their worldviews don’t react well to those who challenge them (part 2 of 2).
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/07/10/predictable-identities-13-totalizing-ideologies" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   13: Totalizing Ideologies
  </a>
  – Every philosophy tries to become an all-encompassing totalizing ideology, a process that ultimately brings misery.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/07/24/predictable-identities-14-frameworks-are-fake/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   14: Frameworks are Fake
  </a>
  – Remembering that all ontologies are fake protects you from thinking any of them have all the answers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/08/14/predictable-identities-15-newcomblike-part-i" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   15: Newcomblike, Part I
  </a>
  – A mysterious child introduces Newcomb’s problem.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/08/28/predictable-identities-16-newcomblike-part-ii/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   16: Newcomblike, Part II
  </a>
  – The only way to be predicted as trustworthy is to be trustworthy, or at least to fool yourself into thinking that you are so.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/09/11/predictable-identities-17-midpoint-review/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   17: Midpoint Review
  </a>

 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/10/02/predictable-identities-18-self-consistency/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   18: Self-consistency
  </a>
  – We tend to believe that we’ve always been the way we are now, and will continue being so. This belief is reassuring, and often quite false.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/10/23/predictable-identities-19-labels/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   19: Labels
  </a>
  – Applying labels to your identity tells others (and yourself) what to expect of you, unless that label is “sapiosexual”.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/11/06/predictable-identities-20-self-and-other-labeling/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   20: Self and Other Labeling
  </a>
  – Exploring the compass of attaching and refusing labels for yourself and for others.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/11/20/predictable-identities-21-enlightenment/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   21: Enlightenment
  </a>
  – The sense of self comes from habitual and repeated thoughts; novel thoughts make the self dissolve.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/12/11/predictable-identities-22-the-entropic-brain/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   22: The Entropic Brain
  </a>
  – How our brain balance order and disorder, and why we sometimes need psychedelics to push us towards the latter.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/12/25/predictable-identities-23-the-self/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   23: The Self
  </a>
  – The sense of self is a useful model, but it doesn’t stand up to detailed scrutiny.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/15/predictable-identities-24-anti-identity/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   24: Anti-Identity
  </a>
  – Start building your identity by identifying as someone who doesn’t have one.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/05/predictable-identities-25-external-control/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   25: External Control
  </a>
  – Our identities control us, and outsiders can control our identities.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/03/04/predictable-identities-26-academic-identity/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
   26: Academic Identity
  </a>
  – “Scientist” is a powerful identity, and its power allows academia to subject its foot soldiers to misery.

  <strong>
   Q: What’s a blogchain?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  A: A series of small posts (300 words each) that should cohere into a long-form exploration of a topic.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: What’s the topic of “Predictable Identities”?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  A: Looking at all inter-human and intra-human relationships through the lens of predictive processing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q:
  </strong>
  <strong>
   Isn’t this stretching the model of predictive processing a bit too far?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  A:
  <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2018/07/09/top-left-mood/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   That never bothered me before
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: Why is this on Ribbonfarm?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Because Venkatesh is the one
  <a href="https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1097610962285191168" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   who came up with the idea
  </a>
  for blogchains, and he graciously invited me and a few others to post our blogchains to Ribbonfarm. Check the rest of them out too!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: When will each post go up? And how many will there be?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Every other Wednesday at 2 pm EST, and at least 34 (for a total of 10,000 words) if I can help it. Which I probably can.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Q: Will you keep writing on Putanumonit?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  A: Of course, but with this new writing commitment and an upcoming travel schedule I will inevitably update slightly less frequently.
