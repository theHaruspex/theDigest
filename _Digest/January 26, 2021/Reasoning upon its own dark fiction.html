  This post is a loving tribute to
  <a class="" href="http://unsongbook.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   Unsong
  </a>
  , an amazing novel of kabbalistic magic, theodicy, and Biblical whale puns by Scott Alexander. The apocalyptic conclusion of Unsong is set for the evening of May 14th in both our universe and its own. This is not a coincidence – our own world may end up destroyed as well as Scott rearranges the higher planes of creation. If you have only two days left until the end of the world,
  <a href="http://unsongbook.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   you should spend them reading Unsong.

 <p>
  Speaking of Biblical things that aren’t coincidences, my life’s path has been predicted with remarkable precision by the Biblical story of Jacob.
 </p>
 <p>
  The name “Jacob”
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+25%3A26&amp;version=ESV" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   comes directly from the Hebrew word for “heel”
  </a>
  , and indeed, though I applied to many schools in the US, I became a
  <a href="http://www.goheels.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   Tar Heel
  </a>
  . Both the patriarch and I
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+28%3A10&amp;version=RSV" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   lived in the city of Be’er Sheba
  </a>
  before embarking on our travels. In the Torah, Jacob climbs a hill and realizes “
  <em>
   <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+28%3A17&amp;version=NRSV" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
    How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
   </a>
  </em>
  “
  <em>
  </em>
  After leaving Be’er Sheba I arrived at
  <strong>
   Chapel
  </strong>
  Hill, an awesome place whose official motto is “
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Hill,_North_Carolina" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   The Southern Part of Heaven
  </a>
  “.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next scene in Jacob’s life
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+29&amp;version=NRSV" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   takes place at an old well
  </a>
  , and the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Well" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   same is true of me
  </a>
  .

 <p>
  I already wrote about how both us Jacobs, while working in a foreign land, dealt with a choice
  <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2017/03/12/goddess-spreadsheet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   between two romantic partners
  </a>
  . People in modern times think that they invented non-traditional relationship structures and come up with
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology_within_polyamory" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   complex terminology to describe them
  </a>
  . For example, “hierarchical polyamory”, or “primary consensual nonmonogamy”. Those two mean the same thing: being committed to loving a single person above all others while maintaining open sexual relationships with other people. With two concubines and a second wife in addition to Rachel, Jacob invented “hierarchical polyamory” more than 3,500 years ago.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to his birth name, Jacob also earned the name “Israel” later in life. I was born in Russia, and earned the right to call myself an Israeli when my family immigrated to Rehovot. Our relatives who chose the US over Israel initially arrived in Rochester, NY. Of course, it turned out that Rochester is
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehovot#Twin_towns_.E2.80.94_Sister_cities" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   a twin city of Rehovot
  </a>
  . In the Torah, “Rehovot” means “a broad place”, and in modern Hebrew it means “street” or “way”. In New York City, I now live on Broadway.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is not a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence.
 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
  Although Jacob’s story is described in the Book of Genesis, my overall narrative as a double immigrant (Russia to Israel to New York) is foretold in the Book of Numbers.
  <em>
   Numbers
  </em>
  tells of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Numbers#Structure" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   two generations’ journey towards the promised land
  </a>
  . When I arrived in New York (a place analogous to Israel for kabbalistic reasons and not just because it’s loud, crowded and full of Jews), I noticed stories from the Book of Numbers everywhere around me.

 <p>
  Like hierarchical polyamory, another invention of American liberals that is older than they realize are
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

  , of which New York is an epitome. This idea comes from

  as well,

 <p>
  Finally,
  <em>
   Numbers 22-24
  </em>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaam" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   tells the cautionary tale
  </a>
  of a wicked man (Bil’am), his misguided ruler (Balak) and his ass. Remarkably, all three names
  <em>
   and
  </em>
  all three characters are combined in a single New Yorker: mayor

 </p>
 <p>
  The Book of Numbers concludes with Jacob’s sons gazing west at the promised land on the other side of the Jordan River. Two years ago I lived in LIC, by the
  <strong>
   Jackson
  </strong>
  Avenue subway, looking west at Manhattan over the river. I couldn’t fight the symbolism of the
  <em>
   Book of Numbers
  </em>
  all around me, so I started writing
  <em>
   Put A Number On It.

 </p>
 <hr/>
 <p>
  My family name is
  <em>
   Falkovich
  </em>
  , which stems from “Falk”, the German word for “falcon”. Falcons are mentioned only twice in the Bible.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first is
  <em>
   <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+14%3A12-13&amp;version=ASV" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
    Deuteronomy 14

  </em>
  :
  <em>

  <em>

    .
   </span>
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  The hidden meaning of this verse is: don’t eat me.
 </p>
 <p>
  The second occurrence is much more interesting.
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+28&amp;version=RSV" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
   Job 28 is a remarkable chapter
  </a>
  , an almost non-sequitur interlude in the middle of one of the Bible’s most dramatic scenes – Job’s remonstration with God. Job 28 contrasts the pursuit of riches with the pursuit of wisdom. Gold and gems are hidden deep underground, and yet men go to great lengths to obtain them:
 </p>
 <p>
  <span class="text Job-28-9" id="en-RSV-13513" style="color:#800080;">

    and overturns mountains by the roots.

    and his eye sees every precious thing.
   </span>

 </p>
 <p>
  Although wisdom is more precious than gold, men do not work as hard to seek it.

  Unsong explores many kabbalistic interpretations of New York City, but it neglects the most sinister name:
  <em>
   The Big Apple
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Scott talks about the deep connection between apples and
  <em>
   knowledge
  </em>
  , but we can get a lot more specific than that. “Apple” doesn’t just symbolize
  <em>
   knowledge
  </em>
  , it symbolizes
  <em>
   forbidden knowledge pursued by a woman through a snake that leads to the downfall of mankind
  </em>
  .

  In the Torah, snakes and
  <em>
   worms
