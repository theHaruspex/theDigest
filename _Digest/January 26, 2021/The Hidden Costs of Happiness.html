  A

 nyone who has ever taken an economics class has heard the phrase, “There’s no such thing as a free lunch.”
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Everything
 </em>
 has a cost, even if that cost is not always immediately apparent. To achieve anything, you must give up something else.
</p>
<p>
 In today’s happiness-obsessed culture, most pursue the opposite: we want to
 <a href="/how-to-be-happy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  be happy
 </a>
 with no costs, and all of the benefits. We want the rewards without the risks, the gain without
 <a href="/question">
  the pain
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Ironically, it is this unwillingness to sacrifice anything that makes us more
 <a href="/the-guide-to-being-miserable" rel="noopener">
  miserable
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Happiness has costs. Happiness is not free. And despite what
 <em>
  Cover Girl
 </em>
 or Tony Robbins or the Dalai Lama once told you, it’s not always easy breezy figuring out how to be happy either. Here’s how to start figuring out the ‘how’ of being happy.
</p>
<p>
 Many people believe that if they just collect a house, a spouse, a car, and exactly 2.5 children, everything will be “perfect.” Tick each item off the list, be happy and old for a couple decades, and then you die.
</p>
<p>
 Unfortunately,
 <a href="/four-stages-of-life" rel="noopener">
  life doesn’t work that way
 </a>
 . Problems don’t go away — they change and evolve. Today’s perfection becomes tomorrow’s swampy cesspool of shit, and the quicker we accept that
 <a href="/the-meaning-of-life" rel="noopener">
  the point of life
 </a>
 is
 <em>
  progress
 </em>
 and not perfection
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-1" id="refmark-1">
  <sup>
   1
  </sup>
 </a>
 , the sooner we can all order a pizza and go home.
</p>
<p>
 Perfection is an idealization. It can be approached but never reached. Whatever your conception of “perfect” is in your pretty little head, it is, in itself, an imperfect
 <em>
  unattainable
 </em>
 idea. In reality though, it does not exist.
</p>
<p>
 We don’t get to decide what perfection is. All we can know is what is better or worse than what is now. And even then we’re often wrong.
</p>
<p>
 When we let go of our conception of what is perfect and what “should” be
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-2" id="refmark-2">
  <sup>
   2
  </sup>
 </a>
 , we relieve ourselves of the stress and frustration of
 <a href="/measure-your-life" rel="noopener">
  living up to some arbitrary standard
 </a>
 . And usually, this standard isn’t even ours! It’s a standard we adopted from other people
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-3" id="refmark-3">
  <sup>
   3
  </sup>
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Accepting imperfection is hard because it forces us to accept
 <em>
  that we have to live with things we don’t like
 </em>
 . We want to hold onto control and let the whole world know how Western democracy should be and why the season finale to
 <em>
  Game of Thrones
 </em>
 was possibly the worst thing that’s ever happened. If only the world would cater to
 <em>
  my wants
 </em>
 , then everything would be better.
</p>
<p>
 But life will never conform to all of our desires. Ever. And we will
 <a href="/wrong-about-everything" rel="noopener">
  always be wrong
 </a>
 about something, in some way. Ironically, it’s the acceptance of this that
 <a href="/stop-trying-to-be-happy" rel="noopener">
  allows us to be happy
 </a>
 , allowing us to appreciate the flaws in ourselves and in others
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-4" id="refmark-4">
  <sup>
   4
  </sup>
 </a>
 <sup>
  ,
 </sup>
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-5" id="refmark-5">
  <sup>
   5
  </sup>
 </a>
 . And that, my friends, is a good thing.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 Blaming the world for our problems is the easy way out. It’s tempting and it can even be satisfying. When we blame others,
 <a href="/are-you-an-emotional-vampire" rel="noopener">
  we get to be the victims
 </a>
 and we get to
 <a href="/outrage" rel="noopener">
  be all emo and indignant
 </a>
 at all of the terrible injustices that have been inflicted upon us. We wallow in our imagined victimhood so as to make ourselves feel unique and special in ways in which we never got to feel unique and special anywhere else.
</p>
<p>
 But our problems are not unique. And we are
 <a href="/being-special">
  not special
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 The beauty of accepting the
 <a href="/trust" rel="noopener">
  imperfection of your own knowledge
 </a>
 is that you can no longer be certain that you’re not to blame for your own problems
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-6" id="refmark-6">
  <sup>

 </a>
 . Are you really late because of traffic? Or could you have left earlier? Is your
 <a href="/psycho" rel="noopener">
  ex really a selfish asshole
 </a>
 ? Or were you manipulative and overly demanding towards him? Is it really the incompetence of your manager that lost you your promotion? Or was there something more you could have done?
</p>
<p>
 The truth is usually somewhere around “both,” — although it varies from situation to situation. But the point is that you can only fix your own imperfections and not the imperfections of others. Your self, your control, your work. So you may as well get started.
</p>
<p>
 Sure, shit happens. It’s not your fault a drunk driver hit you and you lost your leg to a botched surgery. But it is
 <a href="/responsibility-fault-fallacy" rel="noopener">
  your responsibility
 </a>
 to recover from that loss, both physically and
 <a href="/understanding-your-emotions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  emotionally
 </a>
 . So get recovering.
</p>
<p>
 Blaming others for the problems in your life may give you a smidgen of short-term relief, but ultimately it implies something entirely insidious: that you are incapable of
 <a href="/the-prime-belief" rel="noopener">
  controlling your own fate
 </a>
 . And that’s the most depressing assumption of all to live with.
</p>
<p>
 Bravery is not the absence of fear. Bravery is feeling the fear, the
 <a href="/doubt" rel="noopener">
  doubt
 </a>
 , the
 <a href="/insecurity" rel="noopener">
  insecurity
 </a>
 , and deciding that
 <a href="/not-giving-a-fuck" rel="noopener">
  something else is more important
 </a>
 . And then doing it.
</p>
<p>
 If we
 <a href="/emotional-intelligence" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  identify with our moment-to-moment emotional states
 </a>
 and sensitivities, our
 <a href="/happiness-is-not-enough" rel="noopener">
  happiness will surge and crash
 </a>
 like a deregulated Wall Street derivatives orgy. For those of you who don’t know anything about Wall Street, that’s really bad. We want sturdy,
 <a href="/resilience" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  resilient happiness
 </a>
 . Not derivatives orgies.
</p>
<p>
 True, long-lasting, kid-tested-and-mother-approved happiness is derived not from our immediate emotional states — being
 <em>
  constantly
 </em>
 giddy is impossible and would be unbearably annoying. Rather, our long-term happiness is derived from the
 <a href="/personal-values" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  deeper values
 </a>
 we define for ourselves. Ultimate Life Satisfaction™ is not defined by
 <em>
  what
 </em>
 we do and what happens to us, but
 <em>
  why
 </em>
 we do what we do and what it means to us.

<p>
 A better way of saying this is you must
 <em>
  choose what motivates you.
 </em>
 Is it something superficial and external? Or is it something
 <a href="/joy-and-meaning" rel="noopener">
  more meaningful
 </a>
 ?
</p>
<p>
 Being
 <a href="/the-real-value-of-money" rel="noopener">
  motivated by money for the sake of money
 </a>
 leads to unstable emotional regulation and a lot of obnoxious and superficial behavior. Being motivated by money so that one can provide a good life for their family and children is a much sturdier foundation to work with. That deeper purpose will
 <a href="/find-what-you-love" rel="noopener">
  motivate one through the stress and fear and inevitable complications
 </a>
 that a more superficial motivation would not
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-9" id="refmark-9">
  <sup>
   9
  </sup>
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 Being motivated by the approval of others leads to needy and unattractive behavior. Being motivated by the approval of others because you’re an artist and you want to construct art that moves and inspires people in new and powerful ways is far more sustainable and noble. You’ll be able to work through disapproval, embarrassments, and the occasional disaster.
</p>
<p>
 How does one
 <a href="/life-purpose-ebook" rel="noopener">
  find their deeper purpose
 </a>
 ? Well, it’s not easy. But then again, robust and resilient lifelong happiness isn’t easy either. (What, you mean nobody ever told you that?)
</p>
<p>
 A large chunk of
 <a href="/books/subtle-art" rel="noopener">
  my book
 </a>
 is about finding a deeper purpose in our lives. But here’s a hint: it has something to do with growth and contribution. Growth means finding a way to make yourself a better person. Contribution means finding a way to make other people better. Look for ways that you can integrate those into your motivations.
</p>
<p>
 There’s nothing wrong with
 <a href="/sex-and-our-psychological-needs" rel="noopener">
  sex
 </a>
 ,
 <a href="/the-real-value-of-money" rel="noopener">
  money
 </a>
 , and
 <a href="/measure-your-life" rel="noopener">
  rock and roll
 </a>
 (hey, preaching to the choir here). But the sex needs to be motivated by something deeper than sex, the money needs to be motivated by a value more sustainable than simply money, and the rock and roll needs to just fucking rock. Find a way to slide growth and/or contribution under them and bam — you get the best of both worlds.
</p>
<p>
 In
 <a href="/books/models" rel="noopener">
  my book on dating
 </a>
 , I wrote, “You cannot be a powerful life-changing presence to some people without being a complete joke and embarrassment to others.”
</p>
<p>
 Interestingly, this has become probably the most quoted line from the book and the one I get emailed about the most often.

<p>
 The beautiful thing about humanity is the diversity of life values. When you live out your values and let them
 <a href="/how-to-get-motivated" rel="noopener">
  motivate your actions and behaviors
 </a>
 , you will inevitably clash with those whose values contradict your own. These people will not like you. They will leave nasty anonymous comments on
 <a href="/internet">
  the internet
 </a>
 and make inappropriate remarks about your mother. Anything you do that’s important will inevitably be accompanied by those who wish for you to fail. Not because they’re bad people, but because their values differ from yours.
</p>
<p>
 (OK, some of them are fucking awful people.)
</p>
<p>
 As someone much wiser than me once said, “Haters gonna hate.”
</p>
<p>
 In any venture, failure is required to
 <a href="/how-to-change-your-life" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
  make progress
 </a>
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-10" id="refmark-10">
  <sup>

 </a>
 <sup>
  ,
 </sup>
 <a class="fn-ref-mark" href="#footnote-11" id="refmark-11">
  <sup>
   11
  </sup>
 </a>
 . And progress, by definition, is what drives happiness — the progress of ourselves, the progress of others, the progress of our values and what we care about. Without failure, there is no progress and without progress, there is no happiness.
</p>
<p>
 Relish the pain. Bathe in the scorn. One of the
 <a href="/most-important-skill-in-life">
  most important skills in life
 </a>
 is not how to avoid getting knocked down, but rather learning how to stand back up. Haters gonna hate.
