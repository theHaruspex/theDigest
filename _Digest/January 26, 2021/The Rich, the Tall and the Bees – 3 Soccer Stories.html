 <h4>
  The Bees
 </h4>
 <p>
  The hot new release in macroeconomics literature (yes, that’s a thing) is
  <span style="color:#339966;">

    Hive Mind

  </span>
  by Garrett Jones. Jones argues that the average IQ of a nation’s citizens affects their prosperity much more than individual smarts. The argument is that a modern economy requires
  <strong>
   collective intelligence
  </strong>
  , allowing all participants to learn, cooperate and benefit from each other. I propose that
  <strong>
   collective soccer ability
  </strong>
  can help explain why average skill trumps population size in determining national outcomes.
 </p>
 <p>
  Weightlifting and sprinting can probably be practiced in isolation, but a soccer game requires dealing with 21 other players at all times. Soccer players improve at the level of their teammates and competition.
 </p>
 <p>
  As we
  <span style="color:#339966;">

    saw in part 1
   </a>
  </span>
  , small changes in average skill create large difference in the number of extreme performers. Let’s say that Lilliputans are a tiny bit better at soccer, on average, than
  <span style="color:#339966;">
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilliput_and_Blefuscu" style="color:#339966;" target="_blank">
    Blefuscans
   </a>
  </span>
  are. At 5 years old, a Lilliputan of exceptional talent will play against the kids on his block which are almost the same level in each country. At age 8, his small town will have more decent players to challenge him than a similar town in Blefuscu. By the time he’s 12 and playing for a top youth team, the Lilliputan will find a lot more opponents high enough on the bell curve to hone his skill against, creating a large gap in soccer level.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a real life example, the 1987-born cohort of Barcelona FC’s
  <span style="color:#339966;">
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Masia" style="color:#339966;" target="_blank">
    legendary youth academy
   </a>
  </span>
  had Lionel Messi, Cesc Fàbregas and Gerard Piqué playing together since they were 12 (joined by Pedro a few years later). Looking through the biographies of top players, it’s almost impossible to find any that weren’t playing against world class competition by age 14 at the latest (many start competing seriously around age 7-8). In contrast, even if China produced 20 children with enormous soccer potential in a generation, and even if they devoted themselves to soccer, it would be hard for them to improve as fast. The level of competition in their home locales is likely too low, while the size of China and the lack of specialized infrastructure makes it hard to concentrate them in a few super-academies.

 <h4>
  The Rich
 </h4>
 <p>
  This is the section where you’ll learn something about math, not sure if you will learn anything about soccer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of correlating soccer level with a hundred different country variables and finding spurious
  <span style="color:#339966;">
   <a href="https://xkcd.com/882/" style="color:#339966;" target="_blank">
    jelly beans
   </a>
  </span>
  , I restricted myself to testing three hypotheses regarding the effect of the national economy on soccer:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <span style="color:#993300;">
    <strong>
     GDP per capita
    </strong>
   </span>
   will increase soccer level because richer countries can afford better sports infrastructure.
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="color:#993300;">
    <strong>
     Government spending as % of GDP
    </strong>
   </span>
   will increase soccer level because there’s no private profit in youth sports but it can be pushed by a big government.
  </li>
  <li>
   <span style="color:#993300;">
    <strong>
     Unemployment rate
    </strong>
   </span>
   will increase soccer level, because if it’s hard to find a job you may as well play soccer.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  With data from Wikipedia and the

   <a href="http://www.imf.org/en/Data" style="color:#339966;" target="_blank">

  </span>
  , I ran a regression with all three variables and the regions of the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  <img alt="fifa econ regression" class="size-full wp-image-926 alignnone" data-attachment-id="926" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-description="" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="fifa econ regression" data-large-file="https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/fifa-econ-regression2.png?w=596" data-medium-file="https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/fifa-econ-regression2.png?w=300" data-orig-file="https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/fifa-econ-regression2.png" data-orig-size="596,206" data-permalink="https://putanumonit.com/2015/12/01/006-soccer3/fifa-econ-regression-2/" sizes="(max-width: 596px) 100vw, 596px" src="https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/fifa-econ-regression2.png?w=900" srcset="https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/fifa-econ-regression2.png 596w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/fifa-econ-regression2.png?w=150 150w, https://putanumonit.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/fifa-econ-regression2.png?w=300 300w"/>
 </p>
 <p>
  2 out of 3 on what were pretty wild guesses! I’m ready to accept my PhD in macroeconomics. Richer countries and those with bigger governments do in fact get better at soccer, unemployment showed an effect in the predicted direction but it wasn’t significant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here’s the stats-geeky part of today’s show: it seemed interesting to combine the two significant variables into one –
  <span style="color:#993300;">
   government spending per capita
  </span>
  . That variable by itself has a strong positive correlation with soccer level, but when I added it to the regression it showed as insignificant, and suddenly so did
  <span style="color:#993300;">
   GDP per capita!
  </span>
  What happened to turn a good variable bad?
 </p>
 <p>
  When you add a variable that is a product of two others to a regression, it measures the
  <span style="color:#339966;">
   <a href="http://www.theanalysisfactor.com/interpreting-interactions-in-regression/" style="color:#339966;" target="_blank">
    effect of the interaction
   </a>
  </span>
  between the two, not a separate factor. A high coefficient means that the effect of the first variable (i.e. GDP) increases when the second variable (Gov. spending) is high and decreases when it is low, and vice versa. This doesn’t happen here: richer countries are better by the same amount regardless of the size of their government.
 </p>
 <p>
  Why did
  <span style="color:#993300;">
   GDP per capita
  </span>
  become insignificant? There aren’t huge differences in government spending between countries, it’s between 25%-42% for the majority. GDP numbers, however, are all over the map: a quarter of the countries are in the $300-$2000 range and another quarter are between $20,000-$150,000. A Liechtensteinian produces more in a day than a Malawian in a year. This caused the variation in
  <span style="color:#993300;">
   government spend per capita
  </span>
  to be almost wholly dependent on
  <span style="color:#993300;">
   GDP per capita
  </span>
  , the more volatile factor. The correlation between the two is 0.95.
 </p>
 <p>
  A linear regression doesn’t handle well two predictors that correlate so closely, since it doesn’t know which one actually affects the result. Example: sex and drugs could both correlate with rock n’ roll. However, everyone who does sex also does drugs. If you correlated rock n’ roll on both sex and drugs, you wouldn’t know if both sex and drugs caused rock n’ roll or if for example drugs caused extreme rock n’ roll and sex ameliorated the effect a bit. Since sex and drugs go together, either one, or both could be the cause.

  A problem with linear regression is that it’s just so… linear. It doesn’t account well for any other types of relationships, such as threshold effects. Perhaps rock n’ roll only kicks in for a certain dose of drugs? A fun way to explore other effect is with a

 <p>
  For each of the six extreme nodes I looked at the countries that fit the macroeconomic profile and tried to find commonalities between them. Being rich is good for soccer, especially if your pockets are full of a currency that isn’t Euros. If you do pay in Euros, you want to play soccer on a sunny Mediterranean beach. On the other side: being broke, scorching hot or having now or recently been under the thumb of communist dictators makes you bad at soccer. Basically if you’re wealthy, free and the weather is nice everything seems to be going for you, including soccer. If you live in a generally sucky place, soccer is no solace. Life just ain’t fair.

 </p>
 <p>
  Messi’s own career was in danger when he was diagnosed with growth hormone deficiency and the Argentine clubs refused to pay for the drug. Barcelona got Leo two years of growth hormone (HGH) treatment which literally made him tall enough to play soccer, along with possibly leading to

  . Perhaps what contributes to soccer ability isn’t height but rather HGH with all its other benefits, and height is just a measurable proxy. I couldn’t find data on international variation in HGH levels, but it definitely offers a huge boost to athletic performance (and as a result is a
