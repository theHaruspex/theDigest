   10% of the world’s countries experience violent regime change once a year on average
  </a>
  . In middle income countries regimes last 12.5 years on average. 90% of the world’s countries could expect a political revolution, coup d’état or violent change in a human lifetime. Throughout history, that number has been even higher especially when you include the risk of foreign invasion.

 <p>
  Trump is not the Mongol hordes.
 </p>
 <p>
  My great-grandparents fled the Nazis, my grandfather’s brother was sent to a Gulag, my parents grew up in the anti-Semitic Soviet Union. I’m incredibly lucky to have grown up in first-world democracies, but good things aren’t the default state of the world. Good people need to work hard for good things, and sometimes there are setbacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  What struck me the most about today is how inevitable someone like Trump seems in retrospect. There was no jihadi terror attack this week, no freak blizzard in Detroit keeping democrat voters at home. And to be honest, the candidate was barely electable. And still, the people who wanted Trump got their wish. They were always the (electoral college) majority, now we just know that it so.
 </p>
 <p>
  The world didn’t
  <strong>
   become
  </strong>
  worse today, we just found out that it
  <strong>
   was
  </strong>
  like this. If you were a naïve optimist like me and didn’t anticipate this seriously enough, you were wrong. I was wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you’re in shock that Trump won, I am writing this to help you confront the
  <strong>
   <em>
    denial
   </em>
  </strong>
  .

   Yesterday, I asked you to overcome your
   <strong>
    <em>
     anger
    </em>
   </strong>
  </a>
  . If you want to
  <strong>
   <em>
    bargain
   </em>
  </strong>
  about the state of the world, I recommend doing so by
  <a href="http://www.givewell.org/" target="_blank">
   donating to an effective charity
  </a>
  and actually
  <em>
   changing
  </em>
  the world for the better.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s OK to be
  <strong>
   <em>
    depressed
   </em>
  </strong>
  for a while. I recommend gin and
  <a href="https://www.civilization.com/" target="_blank">
   Civilization VI
  </a>
  . For an extra challenge, try to win a cultural victory while maintaining open borders and free trade with all the other civs.
 </p>
 <p>
  But, it would be nice if we could all get to the acceptance stage pronto, the world needs people who have their shit together.
  <strong>
   These aren’t the biggest stakes our generation will face in our lifetimes
  </strong>
  , and we should cast off naïve optimism if we are to do better in the future.

  <p>
   What is true is already so.
   <br/>
   Owning up to it doesn’t make it worse.
   <br/>
   Not being open about it doesn’t make it go away.
   <br/>
   And because it’s true, it is what is there to be interacted with.
   <br/>
   Anything untrue isn’t there to be lived.
   <br/>
   People can stand what is true,
   <br/>
   for they are already enduring it.
